Using a district-level panel data set from 2001 to 2016, we analyze variation in remotely sensed forest losses as well as measures of land-use licensing. We link these outcomes to political incentives arising before idiosyncratically-timed local mayoral elections as well as to price exposure measures based on oil palm soil suitability combined with global price variations for palm oil. Empirical results document increases of about 4% in deforestation in the year prior to local mayoral elections on average. Additionally, palm oil plays a crucial role in driving deforestation dynamics. Deforestation rates increase by 7% in places that experience a one standard deviation increase in local price exposure, but no upcoming elections. These effects are amplified to almost 19% larger forest losses in places that experience pre-election years and a standard deviation higher palm oil price exposure at the same time. We thus find clear evidence for economic and political incentives reinforcing each other as drivers of forest loss and land conversion for oil palm cultivation. (C) 2021 The Authors.

National political institutions constitute an important arena for biodiversity conservation. Yet, the relationship between how democratic these national institutions are and a country's efforts towards and track-record for biodiversity conservation remains poorly understood. In this review, we outline the theoretical links between democracy and biodiversity conservation and review the empirical literature testing them. While more studies reported a positive than a negative relation between democracy and biodiversity conservation (15 vs. 11), the most common result was a mixed relationship (28), often conditioned on economic factors. The use of different proxies to measure biodiversity, including deforestation, protected areas, threatened species, and fishery statistics emerged as a primary obstacle for synthesis. We suggest overcoming this caveat together with a consistent definition of democratic institutions and a standardized statistical framework as research priorities to improve policies against the global biodiversity loss.",1,1,1,1,1,AMBIO,1,1,SPRINGER,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01210-0,NA,NA,Review,10.1007/s13280-019-01210-0,0044-7447,NA,49,2,419,433,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience

In Centre-east Burkina Faso, a peasant resistance to a newly demarcated forest conservation zone turns into an identity and political conflict involving an international conservation organization, the state, decentralized and customary authorities. Based on shared history and residency, a new citizenship of migrants had emerged. These new citizens, finding their given lands within the new forest conservation area, rejected the project-proposed forest boundaries, put forward their citizenship entitlements and engaged in resistance. Eventually they also found themselves in conflict with their polity, lost their claims along with their still-fragile citizenship. Consequently, they were evicted from the forest and labelled as les déguerpis, denied citizenship and became denizens. Beyond confirming the fragile, processual, nature of citizenship these findings also bear theoretical and conceptual implications, challenge the mainstream way environmental politics are analysed and suggest the need to understand political belonging and citizenship as the very basis of environmental struggles.",0,0,0,0,0,Journal of Rural Studies,1,1,Elsevier,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016718306144,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13970263832920563494&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",465,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,3,9,2,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016718306144,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Jp-3O_BY4MEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

This paper presents the results of a four-country study conducted in 2017 in Nepal, Bhutan, India and Myanmar concerning the governance quality of CBFMS. The introduction outlines the global threat to forests, the contribution that forest-based emissions make to climate change, and the policy response of the international and national communities including REDD?+?. The next section provides a snapshot of CBFMS in the four case study countries, and is followed by an account of the methodology, approach, framework of analysis and sampling surveys undertaken during the course of, and informing, the research. The results of the surveys revealed that perceptions of governance quality, as well as governance priorities, varied between the countries, and also at the three levels of government (national, sub-national and local) within a country. For example, Myanmar and Bhutan had very high governance ratings from local levels compared to other levels, whereas, Nepal and India had similar ratings for all levels. Further, regarding the prioritisation of different indicators, Myanmar gave highest priority to “inclusiveness” at the local level but “democracy” at the national level.

Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is all the more important to identify cases in which economic growth has not sparked excessive forest clearance. We address the recent reduction of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon by conducting a statistical analysis to ascertain if different levels of environmental enforcement between two groups of municipalities had any impact on this reduction. Our analysis shows that these targeted, heightened enforcement efforts avoided as much as 10,653 km2 of deforestation, which translates into 1.44 × 10?1 Pg C in avoided emissions for the 3 y period. Moreover, most of the carbon loss and land conversion would have occurred at the expense of closed moist forests.

The focus here is on Akha village heads who have worked their connections in multiple directions, including into Burma, to position themselves as patrons controlling local resource access. With state appointment as border guardians, village heads become chiefs of new kinds of small border entities, protecting the border for the homeland while enabling certain illicit information, people, and goods to cross.

Limited studies, mostly based on experiences in southern Africa, suggest that the relationship between the environment and democratization in sub-Saharan Africa still remains an open question. Furthermore, democratization in sub-Saharan Africa has coincided with the implementation of neoliberal-inspired economic adjustment programs. So far, most discussions of the environmental effects of democratization in the region reflect studies of democratization and neoliberalization which tend to treat the two processes separately, failing to recognize their complex interconnections, both in their material and discursive dimensions. This paper is, therefore, an effort to broaden the discussion of the interactions between democratization and the environment in sub-Saharan Africa. Accordingly, the paper investigates the change in the protection of Karura Forest, a key public forest reserve in Nairobi, Kenya, during a period of multi-party politics and election and neoliberal economic reforms in the country in the early 1990s. The paper uses the urban political ecology perspective to help tease out the interactions between democratization and the environment, and highlights how neoliberalism may complicate those interactions. Ultimately, this paper supports cautionary observations about the environmental effects of democratization in sub-Saharan Africa.",1,1,0,1,2,Political Geography,1,1,NA,2010,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0962629810001332,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77956647914&origin=inward,35,Article,10.1016/j.polgeo.2010.07.003,0962-6298,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/77956647914,29,6,333,342,22,1.47,22,1,15,NA,NA,scopus

1990s on the distribution of economic resources? This paper focuses on closed canopy forests
of Kenya. Anecdotal and case studies show that these forests have suffered severe destruction
since the early 1990s. In this paper I bring new evidence to investigate whether the sudden
introduction of multi-party elections in the Moi era raised political motives to allow district
access to government forest land. Closed canopy forests in the forest reserves of Kenya are
owned and managed by the central government. I create two novel data sets to understand this
issue. First, using Landsat satellite imagery I create a panel data of forest cover. Second, to
uncover the possible mechanisms, I assemble a detailed panel data of forest land allocations by
the government. Satellite imagery reveals that deforestation increased after the introduction
of multi-party politics. This has been driven by more deforestation in loyal districts and little
in opposition districts. The government administrative data shows, that after the introduction
of political competition, forest land has been primarily transferred for private use (to individuals/communities)
rather than for public use (e.g. building schools). Further, within the private
allocations it is land used for squatter settlements that has increased since the introduction of
political competition. Lastly, I find a correlation that in swing districts that greater access to
forest land leads to higher votes for the ruling party in the next election. The findings shed light
into understanding how weak political institutions can lead to serious pathologies in resource
allocation.",1,1,1,1,1,Paper for the World Bank's,1,1,NA,2012,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=8437823195370513196&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",12,CITATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17,1.31,17,1,13,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:LGOcnX0rGXUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Choice experiment is an economic approach in valuing forest ecosystem services. Economic analysis related to public preferences towards forest conservation become increasingly crucial especially in assisting both federal and state Government to conserve and manage forest ecosystem sustainably. Forest conservation at Kelantan is conceptualized with four attributes relating to public preferences: forest function as watershed areas, forest function as flood mitigation, forest as carbon sink and lastly forest landscape as breeding habitat for fauna. The analysis employs a Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) to analyse the public preferences. The results from the CE data indicate that public in Kelantan has the highest preference for forest function as flood mitigation, followed by forest as carbon sink and forest function as watershed areas. However, surprisingly the result also showed public negative preference on attribute forest landscape as breeding habitat for fauna.

Jacobs investigates the conditions under which elected governments invest in long-term social benefits at short-term social cost. Jacobs contends that, along the path to adoption, investment-oriented policies must surmount three distinct hurdles to future-oriented state action: a problem of electoral risk, rooted in the scarcity of voter attention; a problem of prediction, deriving from the complexity of long-term policy effects; and a problem of institutional capacity, arising from interest groups' preferences for distributive gains over intertemporal bargains. Testing this argument through a four-country historical analysis of pension policymaking, the book illuminates crucial differences between the causal logics of distributive and intertemporal politics and makes a case for bringing trade-offs over time to the center of the study of policymaking.",0,1,1,0,0,NA,0,1,books.google.com,2011,https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=gt0iO0BEAaQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&ots=nnZV3EYI3c&sig=7cDYnEoKJZ4w7ZqWWv_reXAJvxQ,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11971049052234121189&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",807,BOOK,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,475,33.93,475,1,14,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:5f8wC7C1IaYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

But, despite widespread concern for over twenty years, only limited progress has been made in controlling deforestation and improving forest management in the humid tropics.

 In this book Alan Grainger offers afresh analysis of the causes of deforestation and presents an integrated strategy for controlling it. His strategy embraces agriculture, forestry and conservation and stresses the need for changes in government policies if land use is to be made more sustainable and the underlying causes of the problem are to be addressed. Controlling Tropical Deforestation is essential reading for policy makers, agronomists, foresters, conservationists and development professionals. To general readers and students on introductory courses at schools and universities it also offers the first concise but comprehensive overview of the causes, scale and consequences of deforestation.

We begin by reviewing the methodological advances that have enabled measurement of forest loss at a fine spatial resolution across the globe. We then develop a simple benchmark model of deforestation based on classic models of natural resource extraction. Extending this approach to incorporate features that characterize deforestation in developing countries—pressure for land use change, significant local and global externalities, weak property rights, and political economy constraints—provides us with a framework for reviewing the fast-growing empirical literature on the economics of deforestation in the tropics. This combination of theory and empirics provides insights not only into the economic drivers and impacts of tropical deforestation but also into policies that may affect its progression.

Changes in expectations are driven by market and non-market factors, but research on market related drivers of land use change so far dominates in the literature. This paper examines how political discourses affect deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon region. Relying on novel data from Twitter, we present the first causal evidence of political discourse on deforestation. Our analysis relies on municipal level monthly panel data for 2019 with alternative remotely sensed measures of forest loss and vegetation fires as outcome variables. The effect of political discourse on these outcomes is identified using a shift-share regression approach. High exposure to laissez-faire political discourses increases forest loss by 2.3-3%, and fires by 2.2%. Our findings are robust across land tenure regimes, varying levels of policy enforcement, and alternative shift-share measures. Moreover, excluding dry season periods from the analysis does not change the main result. Land use in the Brazilian Amazon is highly sensitive to whether, how, and when authorities communicate their will to enforce environmental policy regulations.

However, there remains much unexplained variation in how democratic regimes perform in this regard. Here it is argued that the benefits of democracy for climate change mitigation are limited in the presence of widespread corruption that reduces the capacity of democratic governments to reach climate targets and reduce CO2 emissions. Using a sample of 144 countries over 1970–2011, the previously established relationship between the amount of countries’ CO2 emissions and their level of democracy is revisited. It is empirically tested whether this relationship is instead moderated by the levels of corruption. The results indicate that more democracy is only associated with lower CO2 emissions in low-corruption contexts.

Theorists and policy-makers have been eager to put forward the virtues of democracy as a benign political influence on the environment, especially in contrast to the obvious environmental degradation under Communism that became obvious after its fall. Six measures of environmental protection or degradation are examined as the dependent variables, with the independent variables emerging from earlier tests of the impact of the environment on democracy. In the multiple regression analyses of three of the environmental indicators, deforestation, carbon dioxide emission, and soil erosion by water, the statistically significant effect of democracy on the environment actually was negative, contrary to prediction. In the fourth case, protected land area, the impact of democracy was positive while in the remaining two instances, freshwater availability and soil erosion by chemicals, there was no significant effect of democracy on the environment. Other variables such as economic development, agricultural density, European location, age of the polity, and precipitation behaved empirically as one would intuitively expect. These findings suggest that democracy cannot be viewed unidimensionally in its relationship to the environment, and that assumptions by theorists and policy-makers concerning the positive effect of democracy on the environment need to be re-examined.",1,1,1,1,1,Environmental conflict,1,1,taylorfrancis.com,2018,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780429500794-8/democracy-environment-manus-midlarsky,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=965198473929709911&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",37,NA,10.4324/9780429500794-8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28,4,28,1,7,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:V1lU8OUSZQ0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Myanmar’s transition to democracy is unlikely to counter this trend. Deeply vested interests operate within democratizing countries  that outweigh the support inside governments or civil society for improving forestry conservation. Incumbents also stand to benefit directly from initiatives that promote free trade and further investment in the forestry sector at the expense of the environment and the most vulnerable in society. International organizations returning to Myanmar must fine-tune their policies to accommodate the local political economy of deforestation and should engage with elements on the periphery, dissenting voices inside the government, and a broad range of local civil society organizations.

A recent study postulates that observed reductions in deforestation in three provinces of the Argentinian “Dry Chaco” ecoregion (namely Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Chaco) can be attributed to the effective enforcement of this law by provincial governments. Yet a more contextualized analysis of the local situation raises a number of objections to the methods used and the conclusions drawn in that study. Our analysis (and first-hand experience) shows that provincial governments were unable to enforce the Forest Law, since deforestation in protected areas continued or even increased after its approval and implementation. Our criticism can be categorized into five major challenges: (1) declining deforestation trends started before the Forest Law; (2) a province with a substantial increase in deforestation was omitted; (3) only part of one ecoregion was taken into account in the analysis; (4) deforestation percentage by conservation categories is better than hectares by province as an indicator of law enforcement; and (5) assigning zones to land units prior to land use planning processes is questionable. These challenges, and the lack of a more complete and nuanced political analysis of the situation on the ground, calls into question both the reliability of the results and the usefulness of the conclusions in the study.

Hamza,Sustainable natural resource management must recognise community diversity,sustainable natural resource management must recognise community diversity,"Deforestation and overexploitation of mangrove forests are affecting the livelihoods of millions of families that rely on their ecosystem services. Understanding local perceptions about the status and threats to mangroves is therefore crucial in addressing this issue. This research aims to enhance understanding of how sociodemographic factors influence resource use and perceptions of environmental changes through a questionnaire survey (n?=?592 households) in five locations in Lamu County, home to 62% of Kenya’s mangroves. The results highlight the variability of mangrove use, ecosystem service recognition, and perceptions and drivers of change across locations, which are influenced by sociodemographic factors such as gender, education, and occupation. Although 89% of respondents reported using mangrove products, only 56% were able to identify mangrove ecosystem services, with those without formal education being less likely to recognize them. Interestingly, 50% of respondents perceived an increase in mangrove cover, contrary to research showing mangrove loss in the area over the last decade. Results show that communities are diverse and perceptions vary between groups, suggesting that implementing uniform management measures may be incomplete or ineffective. Awareness campaigns and capacity-building efforts must be tailored to reduce misperceptions about the state of local resources and to address the specific needs and challenges faced by different groups.

This paper aims to analyze the interest positions, participation, and accountability of multiple actors in the process of greening movements in the ROK. These movements were divided into two phases: forest rehabilitation (1973–1997) and urban greening (1998–2017). During the first phase, farmers caused deforestation by slash-and-burn farming and illegal logging, and governmental agencies acted as helpers controlled the farmers’ deforestation activities. During the second phase, government agencies and enterprises caused deforestation with urban development projects, including construction of housings and roads. Multiple actors including citizens, NGOs, and enterprises helped urban greening through campaigns, donations, and monitoring. As a result, managing interest positions is significant to motivate multiple actors to participate in the greening movement. Participation with clear accountability is meaningful for successful greening. Therefore interest-based participation requiring accountability contributes to greening. This phenomenon indicates interconnection for interest positions, participation and accountability should be considered in designing greening policies.",1,0,0,0,0,Forest Science and Technology,0,1,NA,2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054375564&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054375564&origin=inward,171,Article,10.1080/21580103.2018.1512532,2158-0103,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054375564,14,4,169,180,0,0,0,1,7,NA,NA,scopus

However, others argue that democracy leads to environmental degradation. We revisit this contentious relationship between regime type and environment degradation in the context of deforestation. Using panel data on 139 countries during the 1990-2012 period, we find that democracy is associated with lower levels of forest coverage. Although our results appear counter-intuitive, further analyses reveal the positive effect of democracy on forest area coverage is conditional upon the level of economic development. Roughly, at per capita income of about US$8200, the impact of democracy on forest coverage becomes positive.

In particular, it is unclear how deforestation is affected by large-scale development programs, which improve economic welfare and affect other channels that may also be related to deforestation. We study this issue in the context of a nationwide Community-Driven Development (CDD) program that was randomly assigned to villages in rural Gambia. We combine high-resolution satellite data with program implementation information and detailed household-level data to estimate the effect of the program on forest loss and to investigate underlying mechanisms. In areas with meaningful initial forest cover, we find that forest loss is substantially larger in program villages than in control villages. Our estimates imply that forest loss increased by around 11 percent in areas immediately surrounding program villages, over a five-year period after the program ended. If spatial spillovers into control villages are accounted for, we find even larger effects, suggesting that the CDD program accounts for more than a quarter of the forest loss in the years 2011 to 2015 around villages in our sample. This treatment effect is driven by villages with limited access to markets (as measured by poor road infrastructure). Our results also provide suggestive evidence for a relationship between agricultural productivity and deforestation. To further investigate possible channels at the household level, we examine whether the CDD program affected outcomes that could link the CDD to deforestation.

37,paper_431,79,PA Walker,Democracy and environment: congruencies and contradictions in southern Africa,democracy and environment: congruencies and contradictions in southern africa,"Using case studies from Malawi, South Africa, and Mozambique, this paper suggests that there is no necessary relationship between democracy and the environment. In Africa, democratization since the late 1980s has been the source of increased optimism about the environment, particularly as ideas of `participatory' resource management have replaced older top-down conservation models. However, this optimism may be premature. Commonly identified linkages between democracy and environment include increased accountability, development, and participation. In many African countries, however, `democracy' is an empty shell, lacking the political institutions, civil society, and economic and cultural conditions necessary to achieve real democratic competition and accountability. Moreover, the paper illustrates from the case studies that even where the goals of democracy are realized, these can have negative as well as positive environmental consequences. Hence, faith in `democracy'—wherever and in whatever form—to solve Africa's environmental problems may be misplaced. The question that needs to be asked is not whether democracy is good for the environment, but how and when it can be made to work to meet social and environmental objectives.

Where transitions are underway or anticipated, historical precedent and methods for systematically assessing future trends should be used to anticipate likely threats to forest conservation and design appropriate and prescient policy measures to counteract them. Myanmar is transitioning from an authoritarian, centralized state with a highly regulated economy to a more decentralized and economically liberal democracy and is working to end a long-running civil war. With these transitions in mind, we used a horizon-scanning approach to assess the 40 emerging issues most affecting Myanmar's forests, including internal conflict, land-tenure insecurity, large-scale agricultural development, demise of state timber enterprises, shortfalls in government revenue and capacity, and opening of new deforestation frontiers with new roads, mines, and hydroelectric dams. Averting these threats will require, for example, overhauling governance models, building capacity, improving infrastructure-and energy-project planning, and reforming land-tenure and environmental-protection laws. Although challenges to conservation in Myanmar are daunting, the political transition offers an opportunity for conservationists and researchers to help shape a future that enhances Myanmar's social, economic, and environmental potential while learning and applying lessons from other countries.

In this context commons are analyzed as a force to resist neo-liberalism, a main site of conflict over dispossession, and a source of alternatives to capitalism. In this paper we elaborate a view of the commons as the material and symbolic terrain where performative re-articulation of common(s) senses can potentially enact counter-hegemonic socio-ecological configurations. Expressly drawing on the concepts of hegemony, “common-senses” (inspired by Antonio Gramsci) and “performativity” (developed by Judith Butler), we argue that counter-hegemony is performed through everyday practices that rearticulate existing common senses about commons. Commoning is a set of processes/relations enacted to challenge capitalist hegemony and build more just/sustainable societies insofar as it transforms and rearranges common senses in/through praxis. The paper draws on the experience of an anti-mining movement of Casa Pueblo in Puerto Rico, which for the last 35+ years has been developing a project self-described as autogestion.

Forest carbon sink is an important ecosystem to sequestrate carbon for mitigating climate change which is a supplementary measure in addition to the strategies of energy saving and emission reduction. The role of institutional freedom playing in forest protection and which path to achieve forest carbon sink development are worthy of research. The nexus between the social, economic, and the environment should be explored. This paper uses data of 139 countries to explore this problem and proposes three transfer paths assumptions of land use structure, education, and income inequality. The three hypotheses are verified by the mediating model. The three transfer paths are analyzed under different levels of economic growth by the mediating model combined with the threshold model. The results show that the role of education as a transfer path is very clear and income inequality can promote the increase of forest carbon sinks in the case of higher institutional freedom. The three path hypothesis conclusions and related policy implications are summarized by analyzing the results.",1,0,1,0,0,RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING,1,1,ELSEVIER,2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104982,NA,NA,Article,10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.104982,0921-3449,NA,161,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience

Findings showed that some developing tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, thus shifting from declining to expanding forests at a national scale. However, in most of these (e.g. Vietnam), a significant part of the recent increase in national forest cover is associated with an increase in importation of food and timber products from abroad, representing leakage of carbon stocks across international borders. Avoiding deforestation and restoring forests will require a mixture of regulatory approaches, emerging market-based instruments, suasive options, and hybrid management measures. Policy analysis and modelling work showed the high degree of complexity at local levels and highlighted the need to take this heterogeneity into account—it is unlikely that there will be a one size fits all approach to make Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) work. Significant progress was made in the quantification of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes following land-use change in the tropics, contributing to narrower confidence intervals on peat-based emissions and their reporting standards. There are indications that there is only a short and relatively small window of opportunity of making REDD+ work—these included the fact that forest-related emissions as a fraction of total global GHG emissions have been decreasing over time due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions, and that the cost efficiency of REDD+ may be much less than originally thought due to the need to factor in safeguard costs, transaction costs and monitoring costs. Nevertheless, REDD+ has raised global awareness of the world’s forests and the factors affecting them, and future developments should contribute to the emergence of new landscape-based approaches to protecting a wider range of ecosystem services.",1,0,0,0,0,â€¦ Adaptation Strategies for â€¦,0,1,Springer,2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11027-014-9578-z,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4221298238272871130&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",521,HTML,10.1007/s11027-014-9578-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39,3.55,10,4,11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11027-014-9578-z,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:2po832EQlToJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

First in the region to embrace a boldly neoliberal development strategy, Chile's military dictatorship also peacefully gave way to stable, civilian rule and comparative economic success. However, the lens of environmental politics reveals a disturbing underside to the Chilean miracle. Environmental policy, institutions and participation are shaped and constrained by ominous legacies of history, dictatorship, and an economic orthodoxy inimical to sustainability. Democratic rule has opened political space, yet new environmental institutions and procedures exhibit inherited elitist and exclusionary features. Chile's environmental movement likewise demonstrates promise and innovation, but remains grounded in a civil society weakened and atomised by dictatorship and incomplete transition.

This “good business climate” consists of economic incentives (e.g., tax holidays), regulatory concessions (e.g., environmental law exemptions), and imposed political stability (e.g., outlawing strikes, protests, and unions). The results indicate that export partner concentration, commodity concentration, multinational corporate penetration, and International Monetary Fund conditionality increase deforestation more at higher rather than at lower levels of repression.

From the appraisal, lumbering and polewood extraction, fuelwood and charcoal production, crop cultivation, urban growth, animal grazing, and transportation remain important proximate land-use change, deforestation, and forest degradation drivers. Population increase and poverty are considered the most important underlying drivers. Response to economic opportunities with regard to cash (tree) and commercial arable crops and high local and export demands for wood substantially drive land-use change and deforestation.

Menon,Coping with global environmental change -- role of science and democracy.,coping with global environmental change -- role of science and democracy.,"PIP: The world's population increased form about 3 billion in 1960 to 4 billion in 1974, to 5 billion in 1987, and it is projected to grow to 6 billion by 1991 and to 8 billion by 1992. Finite, nonrenewable resources have to satisfy the increased need for sustenance of this population excess in a sustainable economic development mold. Human activity has upset natural processes with negative environmental effects: Minamata disease in Japan caused by heavy metal pollution, global deforestation, and acid rain. The 1972 Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm dealt with industrial pollution. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) was established subsequently. The theory of global warming caused by emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, and halogens as predicted by a Swedish scientist decades ago is accumulating a body of evidence. The International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) of the International Council of Scientific Unions attempt to explore the Earth's physical, chemical, and biological processes to predict global environmental changes. Success mandates data availability. Paleoclimatic evidence indicates previous cataclysms caused by climate change, thus agriculture could be affected massively by global warming. Improved scientific analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and crop simulation models for major agricultural areas are needed. The North-South dialogue in UN forums has been acrimonious without much success, although international cooperation has been fruitful with the adoption of the Montreal Protocol on phasing out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons.

Such punitive actions against environmental defenders can influence both economic development and forest conservation efforts. Yet, little is known about this nexus and the complex relationships between environmental impacts, such as deforestation, and environmental crimes across space and time in many regions such as Latin America. We explored these complex relationships using a database of environmental crimes, threats, and harassment (ECTH) affecting environmental defenders, as well as forest loss data, and municipal-level socioeconomic indicators for nine Latin American countries over a period of eleven years. We found that as deforestation increased, there was a large increase in ECTH episodes related to agricultural activity, while in highly populated municipalities there were more ECTH episodes related to energy production, transportation, and urbanization activities. Overall, the percentage of annual deforestation had a strong influence, which varied according to municipal wealth, population density (PD), and geographical context. Statistically significant increases in violent crimes were found with increasing deforestation, but only in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico, and in municipalities with lower population densities. Conversely, higher income, more populated municipalities were characterized by judicial harassment, as opposed to violent crimes, indicating a type of Environmental Crime Kuznets Curve relationship. A structural equation model where deforestation was driven by the number of ECTHs, as well as percent forest area, PD, latitude, and country showed that the number of ECTH events and country were significant drivers of deforestation. Understanding these complex social-ecological dynamics shows the profound effects that deforestation and unsustainable, and unjust, environmental impacts and conflicts can have across forests and ecosystems of the Global South in terms of social justice and conservation, and thus merits increased protection of environmental defenders in Latin America.",1,0,0,0,0,"Trees, Forests and People",0,1,Elsevier,2024,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666719324001171,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9612855343385153608&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",479,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,3,1,3,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666719324001171,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:SBCw8wC5Z4UJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

A number of proxy variables are used in lieu of environmental commitment, a non-observable variable. Strong evidence is found that democracies sign and ratify more multilateral environmental agreements, participate in more environmental intergovernmental organizations, comply better with reporting requirements under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora, put a greater percentage of their land area under protections status, are more likely to have a National Council on Sustainable Development in their country and have more environmentally relevant information available than non-democracies. The findings suggest that a spread of democracy around the world will lead to enhanced environmental commitment worldwide. Results are robust with respect to inclusion or exclusion of developed countries in the sample. The use of four different variables for democracy also ensures robustness with respect to the measure of democracy. The strong evidence in favour of a positive link between democracy and environmental commitment stands in contrast to the somewhat weak evidence on such a link between democracy and environmental outcomes. The explanation presumably is that theory predicts a stronger positive link of democracy with environmental commitment than with environmental outcomes.",1,1,1,1,1,Journal of peace research,1,0,journals.sagepub.com,2002,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022343302039002001,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10771963990889309700&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",149,NA,10.1177/0022343302039002001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,720,31.3,720,1,23,https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/17881/1/__Libfile_repository_Content_Neumayer%2C%20E_Do%20democracies%20exhibit%20stronger%20international%20environmental%20commitment_Do%20democracies%20exhibit%20stronger%20international%20environmental%20commitment%20%28LSE%20RO%29.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:BKZBai20fZUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The large financial rewards associated with mining create corrupt linkages between the government regulators and mining industry, often resulting in illegal extraction of minerals in environmentally sensitive areas. We develop a model of political-industry corrupted relationship to explore the problem of illegal mining of iron ore and its impact on deforestation in Goa, India. For the regulator, the decision to allow illegal extraction and relaxation from environmental remediation requirement is made with the objective of accumulating illegal wealth while simultaneously mitigating the risks of political ouster and conviction. Results suggest that several factors, such as the relative risks of political survival and conviction, the degree of impatience displayed by the regulator as well as the contribution of the mining sector to the economy, play a role in influencing the extent of illegal mining activity. When the regulator faces a low risk of political ouster, an increase in conviction risk may not provide enough deterrence to illegal mining, resulting in high levels of deforestation.",0,0,0,0,0,Resources Policy,1,0,Elsevier,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142071730524X,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1458654125348178089&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",539,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21,3,21,1,7,https://researchers.mq.edu.au/files/95155571/Author_final_version.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:qUiJ3zIuPhQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Democracies, he explains, typically enjoy higher levels of environmental performance and produce greater innovation in technology, policy, and climate governance than autocracies.

Using a panel data set that combines municipal-level deforestation and election data from 2002 to 2012, I estimate the effect of an incumbent mayor running for re-election on deforestation rates in election periods. I find that deforestation rates increase 8-10% in election years when an incumbent mayor runs for re-election, an amount equivalent to four percent of the total forest lost since the 2004 elections. Electoral deforestation cycles do not appear to be driven by changes in agricultural policy implementation and activity, but are linked to corruption and campaign finance, suggesting that weak institutional constraints facilitate electoral manipulation of forest resources. This phenomenon is not likely limited to Amazonian forests; re-election incentives could very well lead to misallocation of other natural resources in alternate geographies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In the first essay we examine to what extent the Brazil’s institutional environmental framework (IEF) has been successful in curbing deforestation by exploring the determinants of Brazilian deforestation for the period 2004-2015. Our results suggest that the creation of an IEF whilst a positive step, was undermined by weak enforcement such that the introduction of environmental laws as an instrument of the National Environmental Policy had little impact on deforestation. The second essay investigate trends in deforestation in the state of Maranhão. We study the state of Maranhão because of the uniqueness of the area. The artificial line of Legal Amazon crosses part of the state and proposes a natural experiment of deforestation in the under the Legal Amazon Maranhão and Cerrado Maranhão since the former has been subject to fundamentally different environmental policies compared to the latter. We suggest that cloud cover may have acted as an impediment to infringement detection via satellites,as is conducted by the environmental policy program. In our final essay, we investigate further the findings from the previous essay. We use event history analysis to confirm the previous findings by considering the heterogeneity within the region because not all sites have the same risk of deforestation.

Democracy in the Woods addresses these question by examining land rights conflicts--and the fate of forest-dependent peasants--in the context of the different forest property regimes in India, Tanzania, and Mexico. These three countries are prominent in the scholarship and policy debates about national forest policies and land conflicts associated with international support for nature conservation. This unique comparative study of national forestland regimes challenges the received wisdom that redistributive policies necessarily undermine the goals of environmental protection. It shows instead that the form that national environmental protection efforts take--either inclusive (as in Mexico) or exclusive (as in Tanzania and, for the most part, in India)--depends on whether dominant political parties are compelled to create structures of political intermediation that channel peasant demands for forest and land rights into the policy process. This book offers three different tests of this theory of political origins of forestland regimes. First, it explains why it took the Indian political elites nearly sixty years to introduce meaningful reforms of the colonial-era forestland regimes. Second, it successfully explains the rather counterintuitive local outcomes of the programs for formalization of land rights in India, Tanzania, and Mexico. Third, it provides a coherent explanation of why each of these three countries proposes a significantly different distribution of the benefits of forest-based climate change mitigation programs being developed under the auspices of the United Nations.

In its political analysis of the control over and the use of nature, this book opens up new avenues for reflecting on how legacies of the past and international interventions interject into domestic political processes to produce specific configurations of environmental protection and social justice. Democracy in the Woods offers a theoretically rigorous argument about why and in what specific ways politics determine the prospects of a socially just and environmentally secure world.",1,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,books.google.com,2017,https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=X4CuDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&ots=o5JLiu-hMj&sig=f4kEFLQALJBn8Gr7ZMs8KEIHj3c,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12948704316755469488&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",513,BOOK,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,137,17.13,137,1,8,https://www.academia.edu/download/32029595/Kashwan_-_CODESRIA_BULLETIN_3_4_2012.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:sOTGjfgJs7MJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Although forests provide an important range of ecosystem services, they are heavily threatened by deforestation. In recent years, Colombian deforestation rates have rapidly increased, which is partially explained by the end of the armed conflict but is also driven by both legal and illegal factors. We analyze the drivers and the effects of deforestation in Colombia from a systemic perspective, conceptualized under the socio-ecological systems approach. This allows us to map and understand the underlying dynamic complexity of deforestation, considering factors such as low institutional capacity, governance, social context, and imperfect enforcement of regulations. Our results show that both legal and illegal drivers of deforestation create reinforcing loops that will keep increasing deforestation as long as these activities are profitable. The balancing loops that could slow down and stop deforestation are determined by governance schemes, the self-regulation of local communities, and the recognition of the valuable services provided by forests. Given the heterogeneous conditions in Colombia, deforestation requires local analysis which encompasses the site-specific context.

63,paper_1318,504,"D Shearman, JW Smith",The climate change challenge and the failure of democracy,the climate change challenge and the failure of democracy,"Climate change threatens the future of civilization, but humanity is impotent in effecting solutions. Even in those nations with a commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions, they continue to rise. This failure mirrors those in many other spheres that deplete the fish of the sea, erode fertile land, destroy native forests, pollute rivers and streams, and utilize the world's natural resources beyond their replacement rate. In this provocative book, Shearman and Smith present evidence that the fundamental problem causing environmental destruction—and climate change in particular—is the operation of liberal democracy. Its flaws and contradictions bestow upon government—and its institutions, laws, and the markets and corporations that provide its sustenance—an inability to make decisions that could provide a sustainable society.

Having argued that democracy has failed humanity, the authors go even further and demonstrate that this failure can easily lead to authoritarianism without our even noticing. Even more provocatively, they assert that there is merit in preparing for this eventuality if we want to survive climate change. They are not suggesting that existing authoritarian regimes are more successful in mitigating greenhouse emissions, for to be successful economically they have adopted the market system with alacrity. Nevertheless, the authors conclude that an authoritarian form of government is necessary, but this will be governance by experts and not by those who seek power. There are in existence highly successful authoritarian structures—for example, in medicine and in corporate empires—that are capable of implementing urgent decisions impossible under liberal democracy. Society is verging on a philosophical choice between liberty or life. But there is a third way between democracy and authoritarianism that the authors leave for the final chapter. Having brought the reader to the realization that in order to halt or even slow the disastrous process of climate change we must choose between liberal democracy and a form of authoritarian government by experts, the authors offer up a radical reform of democracy that would entail the painful choice of curtailing our worldwide reliance on growth economies, along with various legal and fiscal reforms. Unpalatable as this choice may be, they argue for the adoption of this fundamental reform of democracy over the journey to authoritarianism.",1,1,1,1,1,NA,1,1,books.google.com,2007,https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EbrOEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&ots=X23PYJMhCH&sig=nz6sUe_0V63FIgDdpzE5LJAKp20,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15405561727031454434&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",264,BOOK,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,504,28,252,2,18,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:4ioQwcSMy9UJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

A literature review indicates that agricultural expansion during the past was highly correlated with discriminatory labour and educational politics. These past politics have repercussions until today, not only on the persistence of rural poverty but also on forest cover loss. After a period of large-scale agricultural and pasture expansion, it appears that spontaneous colonisation has become the single most important direct source of deforestation. Rural non-farm employment, schooling, communal tenure regimes and ethnicity are among the most important parameters of land use decisions. However, contrary to common believes, there is evidence that deforestation is not dominated by subsistence-driven patterns, and that agricultural intensification techniques promoted by several environmental movements increase the demand for additional land.",1,0,0,0,0,â€¦ and Conservation of â€¦,1,0,Springer,2005,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-27138-4_19,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10251223139119319916&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",847,NA,10.1007/3-540-27138-4_19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,0.15,1,4,20,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:bMt4uCGpQ44J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Satellite image analysis, supported by semi-structured interviews with farmers and representatives of key institutions, shows that deforestation for commercial agriculture in Santa Cruz continues and has increased in certain “hotspots”. Previous research has shown that the environmental effects of neoliberalism on forest cover are varied, but more broadly, reduced state intervention has meant less environmental regulation and greater deforestation, while strong government is better able to curtail deforestation. Although neoliberal policies triggered an unprecedented level of forest clearing in Bolivia, rates have generally continued to increase and can be indirectly linked to the administration's new agrarian reform and pro-environmental regulations. This trend is counterintuitive and stems from unanticipated responses such as deforestation through fire to prove productive use under the reform's socio-economic function requirements. Given increased regulation and enforcement of forest clearing and burning under Morales, in contrast to the neoliberal era, our analyses suggest that rates will continue to increase under the current political climate, which has further polarized the opposition in Santa Cruz",1,0,0,0,0,Land Use Policy,1,1,Elsevier,2011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837710000669,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=821502839062439063&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",266,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,87,6.21,29,3,14,https://www.academia.edu/download/72429353/j.landusepol.2010.06.00420211013-26684-r4lqvm.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:l6RKyHqQZgsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

According to Selznick, TVA's leaders turned the administration of its land use programs over to local elites who were indifferent to the programs’ goals, thereby preventing TVA from becoming “a first line, committed conservation agency” (p. xii). This article extends Selznick's analysis and then puts the extended argument and contradictory claims by more recent students of TVA to a test with data on reforestation in the southern Appalachians between 1935 and 1975.

These ideals are frequently conceived as being in conflict, as democracy is perceived as too slow and cumbersome to deliver the urgent large-scale collective action needed to tackle environmental problems. Theories addressing the democracy-environment nexus can be situated on a spectrum from theories of ecological democracy that are more critical of existing liberal democratic institutions to theories of environmental democracy that call for reforming rather than radically transforming or dismantling those institutions. This article reviews theoretical and empirical scholarship on the democracy-environment nexus. We find continued theoretical and empirical diversity in the field, as well as vibrant debates on democratising global environmental politics, local material practices, and non-human representation. We argue for stronger dialogue between environmental political theory and empirical, policy-oriented research on democracy and sustainability, as well as further exploration of complementarities between ecological and environmental democracy.

The paper examines the reasons for deforestation and investigates the factors accountable for it. The analysis builds on authors-compiled cross-national dataset on 185 countries over the time period of twenty years, from 1990 to 2010. We find that, first, nation's intelligence reduces significantly the level of deforestation in a state. Moreover, the nations' IQ seems to play an offsetting role in the natural resource conservation (forest management) in the countries with weak democratic institutions. The analysis also discovered the presence of the U-shaped relationship between democracy and deforestation. Intelligence sheds more light on this interconnection and explains the results.

The main implication from our study is that intelligence not only shapes formal rules and informal regulations such as social trust, norms and traditions but also it has the ability to reverse the paradoxical process known as resource curse.

Despite the popularity of these reforms, there is limited scientific evidence on the environmental effects of decentralization, especially in tropical biomes. This study presents evidence on the institutional conditions under which decentralization is likely to be successful in sustaining forests. We draw on common-pool resource theory to argue that the environmental impact of decentralization hinges on the ability of reforms to engage local forest users in the governance of forests. Using matching techniques, we analyze longitudinal field observations on both social and biophysical characteristics in a large number of local government territories in Bolivia (a country with a decentralized forestry policy) and Peru (a country with a much more centralized forestry policy). We find that territories with a decentralized forest governance structure have more stable forest cover, but only when local forest user groups actively engage with the local government officials. We provide evidence in support of a possible causal process behind these results: When user groups engage with the decentralized units, it creates a more enabling environment for effective local governance of forests, including more local government-led forest governance activities, fora for the resolution of forest-related conflicts, intermunicipal cooperation in the forestry sector, and stronger technical capabilities of the local government staff.",1,0,0,0,0,Proceedings of the â€¦,1,1,pnas.org,2016,https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1610650114,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=2981574009284704094&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",20,NA,10.1073/pnas.1610650114,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,147,16.33,37,4,9,https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1610650114,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:XrfzrsOtYCkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

This kind of development has been promoted through international agreements like the Agenda 21, which achieved an improvement of the working conditions for NGOs. Within this treaty the signatory states are asked to promote participation by various social groupings in political decision processes. In general, participation is possible on different levels, be it on local, regional, national or international scale. The participation of NGO's on deciding processes in forest policy is facing positive as well as negative aspects. Problematic are the deficiency of democracy of many NGO's, the undermining of decisions due to eloquent minorities, probably with increased expenditure and an enormous amount of time due to the participation of numerous groupings.

The book specifically demonstrates the nuances within human-environmental linkages, by showing how environmental concerns are not only ecological in content but also political. In India a large part of the forests and their surrounding areas were inhabited far before they were designated as protected areas and inviolate zones, with the local population reliant on forests for their survival and livelihoods. Thus, socioecological conflicts between the forest dependents and official state bodies have been widespread. This book uses a political ecology lens to explore the complex interplay between current norms of forest conservation and environmental subjectivities, illustrating contemporary articulation of forest rights and the complex mediations between forest dependents and different state and non-state bodies in designing and implementing regulatory standards for wildlife and forest protection. It foregrounds the issues of identity, migration and cultural politics while discussing the politics of conservation.

Believing that they could persuade loggers to use less predatory practices, the mainstream NGOs developed a certification scheme in association with timber companies known as the FSC - Forest Stewardship Council.

Moog,The Politics of Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives: The Crisis of the Forest Stewardship Council,the politics of multi-stakeholder initiatives: the crisis of the forest stewardship council,"Multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) have become a vital part of the organizational landscape for corporate social responsibility. Recent debates have explored whether these initiatives represent opportunities for the “democratization” of transnational corporations, facilitating civic participation in the extension of corporate responsibility, or whether they constitute new arenas for the expansion of corporate influence and the private capture of regulatory power. In this article, we explore the political dynamics of these new governance initiatives by presenting an in-depth case study of an organization often heralded as a model MSI: the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). An effort to address global deforestation in the wake of failed efforts to agree a multilateral convention on forests at the Rio Summit (UNCED) in 1992, the FSC was launched in 1993 as a non-state regulatory experiment: a transnational MSI, administering a global eco-labeling scheme for timber and forest products. We trace the scheme’s evolution over the past two decades, showing that while the FSC has successfully facilitated multi-sectoral determination of new standards for forestry, it has nevertheless failed to transform commercial forestry practices or stem the tide of tropical deforestation. Applying a neo-Gramscian analysis to the organizational evolution of the FSC, we examine how broader market forces and resource imbalances between non-governmental and market actors can serve to limit the effectiveness of MSIs in the current neo-liberal environment.

The factors related to agricultural production, population, economy and governmental policies of each country are hypothesised to affect deforestation. Results of the Latin American countries show significant evidence of an EKC relationship for deforestation and also relevance of the institutional factors to reduce the rate of deforestation. Improvements in institutions for secure property rights and better environmental policies can thus significantly reduce the rate of deforestation without hindering the level of economic growth. Evidence also suggests that the effect of agricultural production on deforestation could be halted by strengthening institutional factors.

We find that deforestation is consistently associated with greater accessibility (as influenced by natural features such as slope and elevation and built infrastructure such as roads, cities, and cleared areas) and with higher economic returns (from agriculture, livestock, and timber). Some demographic variables are consistently associated with less deforestation (e.g., Indigenous people, poverty, and age) or more deforestation (e.g., population), and others are not associated with the level of deforestation (e.g., education and gender). Policies that directly influence allowable land-use activities are associated with less deforestation (e.g., protected areas, enforcement of forest laws, payments for ecosystem services, community forest management, and certification of sustainable commodities). But policies and institutions that primarily seek other ends are not consistently associated with more or less deforestation (e.g., democracy, general governance, conflict abatement, and land-tenure security).

The REDD mechanism, still in discussion, would be in charge of distilling the right incentives and promoting the right policies for fostering forest conservation. The estimation of reduced emissions induced by the mechanism has been raised as an issue, either for issuing the proper amount of carbon credits or for providing appropriate compensations of foregone revenues and other costs to host countries. This estimation would be based on the gap between observed deforestation and a counterfactual value. Although any prediction of deforestation rates (i.e. business-as-usual scenarios) is challenging, and any negotiated target is subject to obvious political influence, these two ways have been prioritirized so far to determine the counterfactual value. In other words proposals focused on a results-based approach, the relevance of which is questionable because estimations of avoided deforestation are hardly reliable. With this approach, issuance of carbon credits and distribution of financial compensations could threaten respectively environmental integrity of the scheme and equity outcomes. Rather than considering overall deforestation (predicted and observed), we argue that a REDD mechanism would gain from linking distribution of carbon finance to real efforts (opposed to “results”) that developing countries implement for slowing deforestation rates. This would provide strong incentives to design and enforce suitable policies and measures. The methodology we present to measure these efforts (labeled Compensated Successful Efforts) is based on the rationale that overall deforestation is partly due to structural factors, and to domestic policies and measures. This typology differs from others presented in the literature such as proximate/underlying causes, or economic/institutional factors. Using an econometric model, our approach estimates efforts that are (i) independent of structural factors (economic development, population, initial forest area, agricultural export prices), (ii) estimated ex post at the end of the crediting period, and (iii) relative to other countries. In order to illustrate the methodology we apply the model to a panel of 48 countries (Asia, Latin America, Africa) and four periods between 1970 and 2005. We conclude on the feasibility to estimate avoided deforestation using the Compensated Successful Efforts approach. In addition to being conservative from an environmental perspective, this approach tends to guarantee fairness by accounting for dramatic changes during the commitment period. Last, such estimations of avoided deforestation could provide guidance for decisions on further financing of national programs to curb deforestation, as it would help to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful policies.",0,0,0,0,0,Ecological economics,1,0,Elsevier,2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908002577,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15642236303353816266&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",338,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,205,12.81,68,3,16,https://shs.hal.science/halshs-00556933/document,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:yqQfsgpjFNkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Empirical contribution to the environmental politics debate,does democracy really improve environmental quality? empirical contribution to the environmental politics debate,"The theoretical debate on democracy—environment remains contentious in the environmental politics literature. The existing empirical studies have attempted to explore the effect of democracy on environmental degradation. However, there are limitations in these studies regarding how democracy was measured. Also, the prior empirical studies have been silent on how democracy moderates the effect of economic growth and energy consumption on the environment. In this study, we employed dynamic and static econometric techniques to explore the effect of democracy on the environment using comprehensive data for 46 sub-Saharan African countries (SSA). As institutionalised democracy is a multi-faceted concept, we follow the political science literature to use high-level democracy indices such as electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian democracy to examine their respective effect on environmental degradation. Using the dynamic system-GMM and Lewbel two-stage least squares technique to control endogeneity, our empirical results indicate that the high-level democracy indicators drive CO2 emissions in SSA. We also observed that the high-level democracy indicators moderate GDP per capita to reduce CO2 emissions in SSA. The regional analysis reveals that the high-level democracy indicators spur CO2 emissions in West Africa while reducing CO2 emissions in Southern and Central-Eastern Africa. Further, the high-level democracy indicators moderate GDP per capita to reduce CO2 emissions in West Africa while increasing CO2 emissions in Southern and Central-Eastern Africa. The findings also indicate that the high-level democracy indicators moderate energy consumption to increase CO2 emissions in West Africa and Central-Eastern Africa, not SSA and Southern Africa. These results are robust to using ecological footprint as a broader measure of environmental degradation. The policy implications of these findings for SSA and the sub-regions are discussed.",0,1,1,1,0,Energy Economics,1,1,Elsevier,2022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988322001190,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4872649243608466889&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",360,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,84,28,28,3,3,https://v-dem.net/media/publications/Users_Working_Paper_49.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:ycVbsKsgn0MJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Baldessari,Rethinking Public Participation in Forest Policies: A Literature Review of Participatory Techniques,rethinking public participation in forest policies: a literature review of participatory techniques,"Recently, the concept of participatory democracy developed in the early 1970s has come back into fashion to revitalize the public involvement in political decision-making processes. Public participation in forest policy has been fully conceptualized by the scientific community in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but in many contexts, the practical application remains unfulfilled. The aim of this study is to identify and analyse the participatory techniques used in the literature to increase knowledge and facilitate its transferability into forest policies and strategies. A literature review was carried out to offer an overview of the participatory techniques adopted in the decision-making process. At the end of the literature review, 24 participatory techniques were identified based on over 2000 publications. Afterwards, the participatory techniques were assessed using seven indicators (degree of participation, type and number of participants, type of selection, time scale, cost, and potential influence on policy). The results showed that the type of actors involved in the participatory technique is a key variable for the complexity and usefulness of the process, while the number of participants influences how information is disseminated. The Correspondence Analysis highlighted that the participatory techniques can be divided into four groups: the first group includes those techniques with a high degree of participation (i.e., collaborate) and a contextual high potential influence on policies (e.g., citizens’ juries and wisdom council); the second one includes techniques with a low degree of participation (inform) and influence on policies (e.g., social media, adverting, surveys, and polls); while the third and fourth groups consist of those with a medium–high degree of participation (consult or involve), but a variable type of selection and number of participants, and consequently of time and costs.",0,1,0,1,0,Forests,1,1,NA,2024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205047916&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85205047916&origin=inward,24,Review,10.3390/f15091514,1999-4907,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85205047916,15,9,NA,NA,1,1,1,1,1,NA,NA,scopus

Protected areas represent one intervention for decreasing forest loss and aiding conservation efforts, yet there is intense human pressure on at least one-third of protected areas globally. There have been numerous studies addressing the extent and identifying drivers of deforestation at the local, regional, and global level. Yet few have focused on drivers of deforestation in protected areas in high thematic detail. Here we use a new crowdsourced data set on drivers of tropical forest loss for the period 2008–2019, which has been collected using the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing application for visual interpretation of very high-resolution imagery by volunteers. Extending on the published data on tree cover and forest loss from the Global Forest Change initiative, we investigate the dominant drivers of deforestation in tropical protected areas situated within 30° north and south of the equator. We find the deforestation rate in protected areas to be lower than the continental average for the Latin Americas (3.4% in protected areas compared to 5.4%) and Africa (3.3% compared to 3.9%), but it exceeds that of unprotected land in Asia (8.5% compared to 8.1%). Consistent with findings from foregoing studies, we also find that pastures and other subsistence agriculture are the dominant deforestation driver in the Latin Americas, while forest management, oil palm, shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture dominate in Asia, and shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture is the main driver in Africa. However, we find contrasting results in relation to the degree of protection, which indicate that the rate of deforestation in Latin America and Africa in strictly protected areas might even exceed that of areas with no strict protection. This crucial finding highlights the need for further studies based on a bottom up crowdsourced, data collection approach, to investigate drivers of deforestation both inside and outside protected areas.",1,0,0,0,0,Frontiers in â€¦,0,1,frontiersin.org,2022,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2022.830248/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13696103730831126256&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",79,HTML,10.3389/fcosc.2022.830248,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28,9.33,7,4,3,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcosc.2022.830248/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:8G4XM8dVEr4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Government policies and weak property rights contribute to this process by encouraging landowners and landless to accelerate land clearing. Using panel data common to previous studies, we add the dimension of new political regimes, democratic and non-democratic, and investigate how the rate of agricultural land expansion in tropical countries depends on the nature and persistence of each regime. We find that both new autocratic and democratic regimes have accelerated the expansion of agricultural land, thus yielding support to some of the findings in the earlier literature. Interesting differences emerge between regions, with the impact being most pronounced in Latin America. We interpret these results mainly in the context of increasing tenure and ownership insecurity, which in turn is driven by the tendency of new regimes to implement land reforms as a form of social and economic policy or voter payback. The argument is developed more formally using a simple competitive land use model that incorporates political regime dependent confiscation risk and agricultural subsidy policy.",1,1,1,1,1,Environmental and Resource Economics,1,1,Springer,2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-015-9880-6,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7137261821127002328&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",5,NA,10.1007/s10640-015-9880-6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34,3.78,17,2,9,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:2Ig7vc-lDGMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Specifically, we argue that in return for campaign contributions, Colombian mayors who rely on donor-funding (compared with those who do not) choose not to enforce sanctions against illegal deforestation activities. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that deforestation is significantly higher in municipalities that elect donor-funded as opposed to self-funded politicians. Further analysis shows that only part of this effect can be explained by differences in contracting practices by donor-funded mayors. Instead, evidence of heterogeneity in the effects according to the presence of alternative formal and informal enforcement institutions, and analysis of fire clearance, support the interpretation that campaign contributions buy reductions in the enforcement of environmental regulations.",1,1,1,1,1,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0003055423000412,NA,NA,Article,10.1017/S0003055423000412,0003-0554,NA,118,2,635,653,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience

These deliberative methods are subject to criticisms. One issue of concern is that the socio-economic inequalities among members of the deliberative group may severely impede communication and consequently distort deliberative outcomes. To examine such possibility we applied the deliberative methodology in a case study of forest conservation in Colombia. We found that those individuals who assumed social (environmental) leadership positions tended to dominate group discussion. Nevertheless, the variations in the capacity to engage in group deliberation were better explained by participants' personal characteristics than external constraints or group pressure. Also, there was little evidence that leadership and domination in group deliberation significantly influenced participants' stated WTP.

Government proneness to accept political contributions or bribes and its willingness to provide subsidies cause farmers to adopt inefficient modes of production as a mechanism to capture such subsidies.

Better public oversight and regulation of the forest commons is thus linked to democratization. Yet evidence suggests that in a number of important cases, democratization can accelerate deforestation. Using the cases of South Nandi and Karura Forests in Kenya, this article argues that to understand why requires more careful examination of how forests are incorporated into patronage networks and how these networks are impacted by democratization struggles. Specifically, this article argues that accelerated deforestation occurs when institutional configurations allow abuse and create opportunity for forests to become incorporated into patronage networks. Democratization can then exacerbate deforestation when, as in Kenya, more competitive elections produce stresses on these patronage networks and hence create incentives for state actors to increase accumulation of forest resources for political purposes. Further, the overall volatility of democratization struggles, which makes changes in government more likely, creates incentives for those with privileged access to forests to accumulate more rapidly with no concern for sustainability in the long run. However, such forest encroachments may also generate resistance and movements aimed at re-imposing regulation on the use of the forest.

The former emphasizes the positive role of local communities and sees law enforcement programs as, at least potentially, counterproductive to environmental policy. While this perception fails to take the rule of law seriously, it shows the importance of local arrangements for sustainable use of forests. On the other hand, there is a view of deforestation that defines it only in juridical terms as 'illegal logging', without taking into account the variety and complexity of social problems at local level. The paper reviews some of the ways social sciences help us to overcome the limitations of both views. However, it also points at an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed by social disciplines: the question of local democracy. While most observers agree on the need of democratic institutions at the local level, there is not enough research and deliberation on the social conditions that make those institutions possible. This is a challenge for social sciences, due to the growing complexity of rural societies, a complexity that includes inter alia conflicts between owners and non-owners of natural resources, as well as the presence of 'external' social actors such as NGOs.",1,1,1,1,1,Journal of Sustainable Forestry,1,1,NA,2004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=12444257455&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=12444257455&origin=inward,70,Article,10.1300/J091v19n01_05,1054-9811,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/12444257455,19,1,81,96,4,0.19,4,1,21,NA,NA,scopus

This article sets out a framework for measuring the cost effectiveness of alternative policies—both command-and-control and incentive-based—in the Brazilian Amazon. First, I estimate the demand for deforestation on private properties, exploiting regional variation in transportation costs as a means to recover farmers’ responses to permanent policies. Here, rescaling transportation costs using local yields allows me to express changes in farmers’ valuations in dollars per hectare. I then use the estimated demand to infer farmers’ willingness to deforest under different counterfactual policies, such as payments to avoid deforestation and taxes on land use, along with the corresponding potential farmers’ lost surpluses. The results indicate that payment programmes and land use taxes on agricultural land can be highly effective in preserving the rainforest and also be substantially less expensive than command-and-control policies (approximately 8 times less costly).

Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale.

However, given their mixed effectiveness, we want to know when they have impacts internally and, if they do, when they have spillovers. Political economy posits roles for the level of government. One hypothesis is that federal PAs avoid more internal deforestation than state PAs since federal agencies consider gains for other jurisdictions. Such political differences as well as economic mechanisms can cause PA spillovers to vary greatly, even from “leakage,” more deforestation elsewhere, to “blockage,” less deforestation elsewhere. We examine internal impacts and local spillovers for Brazilian Amazon federal and state agencies. Outside the region’s “arc of deforestation,” we confirm little internal impact and show no spillovers. In the “arc,” we test impacts by state, as states are large and feature considerably different dynamics. For internal impacts, estimates for federal PAs and indigenous lands are higher than for state PAs. For local spillover impacts, estimates for most arc states either are not significant or are not robust; however, for Pará, federal PAs and indigenous lands feature both internal impacts and local spillovers. Yet, the spillovers in Pará go in opposite directions across agencies, leakage for indigenous lands but blockage for federal PAs, suggesting a stronger external signal from the environmental agency.

Evidence suggests that governance may play a critical role in influencing deforestation, and while a number of studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between national-level governance and deforestation, much remains to be known about the relative importance of subnational governance to deforestation outcomes. With a focus on the Brazilian Amazon, this study aims to understand the relationship between governance and deforestation at the municipal level.

We compiled a dataset of 22 municipal-level governance variables covering the 2005–2018 period for 457 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon. Using an econometric approach, we tested the relationship between governance variables and deforestation rates in a fixed-effects panel regression analysis. We found that municipalities with increasing numbers of agricultural companies tended to have higher rates of deforestation, municipalities with an environmental fund tended to have lower rates of deforestation, and municipalities that had previously elected a female mayor tended to have lower rates of deforestation. These results add to the wider conversation on the role of local-level governance, revealing that certain governance variables may contribute to halting deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.",1,1,1,1,1,Plos one,1,1,journals.plos.org,2022,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269729,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=569230368150884364&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",462,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,2.33,1,6,3,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269729,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:DJD_AAFQ5gcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

This deforestation contributes to biodiversity loss, climate change, the spread of infectious diseases, and damage to rural and indigenous livelihoods. Hundreds of articles have been published on the topic of deforestation across Amazonia, yet there has been no recent synthesis of deforestation drivers and deforestation-control policy effectiveness in the region. Here we undertook the first systematic review of papers published between 2000 and 2021 that have causally linked proximate and underlying drivers and policies to deforestation outcomes in Amazonia. In the 155 articles that met our inclusion criteria, we find that causal research is concentrated in Brazil, and to a lesser degree Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. There has been little study of the Guianas, Venezuela or Colombia. Large- and small-scale agriculture linked to improved market access and high agricultural prices are frequently researched underlying drivers of deforestation across the heavily researched regions. In the Guianas research focuses on mining with little focus on underlying causes. Research on infrastructure expansion, mining, and oil extraction and on technological, sociocultural, and institutional factors remains sparse. Many public and private policies have been found to be effective in controlling deforestation across the biome, with protected areas and public policies standing out as particularly successful in slowing deforestation vis-à-vis supply chain approaches. Frontier age, land tenure, and policy interactions are key moderating factors affecting the outcomes of different underlying causes and policies. Our findings indicate a greater need for research on (i) additional deforestation drivers beyond agriculture and economic factors, (ii) the complex interactions between different drivers and deforestation control policies, (iii) causes underlying deforestation in low or new deforestation areas, and (iv) the dynamics between Amazonian subregions and countries. Understanding the extent and diversity of deforestation drivers and effectiveness of existing deforestation mitigation policies across Amazonia is a necessary first step toward designing policies to further reduce deforestation in the biome.",1,1,1,1,1,Environmental â€¦,1,1,iopscience.iop.org,2023,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acd408/meta,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6578867248652477348&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",167,HTML,10.1088/1748-9326/acd408,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,49,24.5,12,4,2,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acd408/meta,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:pONhBOjUTFsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

It is now widely perceived as having real capacity for making an effective contribution towards addressing the environmental, socioeconomic and political problems raised by Nepal’s rapid progression from a feudal and isolated state into the modern, globalised world. This paper analyses the evolution of community forestry in Nepal, focusing on how policy, institutions and practical innovations evolved together to create a robust system of community forestry. It highlights the key outcomes of community forestry in the aspects of livelihoods and democracy and identifies two key lessons in relation to forest resource management, social inclusion and contribution to democratization in Nepal. First, mechanisms for policy amendment and revision for community-based forest management need to be based on real-life experiences rather than ad hoc and top-down decisionmaking. Second, if given complete autonomy and devolution of power, community forest user groups can become viable local institutions for sustaining forests and local democracy, and delivering rural development services by establishing partnership with many NGOs and private sector service providers.",1,0,0,0,0,Journal of Forest and â€¦,1,1,forestaction.org,2007,https://www.forestaction.org/app/webroot/vendor/tinymce/editor/plugins/filemanager/files/images/stories/pdfs/journal_of_forest_and_livelihood/vol6_2/2_Community%20forestry-final.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4032451886012851000&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",591,PDF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,215,11.94,54,4,18,https://www.forestaction.org/app/webroot/vendor/tinymce/editor/plugins/filemanager/files/images/stories/pdfs/journal_of_forest_and_livelihood/vol6_2/2_Community%20forestry-final.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:OGOmH6Al9jcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Focusing on one of the world’s deforestation hotspots, the Argentine Chaco Forest, we argue that subnational variation in the implementation of forest protection legislation is driven by governors’ attempts to avoid conflict produced by agricultural expansion. Through process tracing, we show how governors’ implementation decisions—regarding both the design and enforcement of provincial regulations—sought to mitigate pressures from large producers opposed to clearing restrictions and from various groups contesting agricultural expansion. As the power of these actors varies across provinces, governors’ conflict avoidance strategies resulted in markedly different subnational regulations as well as contrasting levels of enforcement and deforestation. We substantiate our argument through an empirical strategy that combines department-level geocoded data on deforestation and levels of forest protection in the Argentine Chaco with extensive fieldwork and interviews in the core provinces in which the forest is located. Our findings aim to contribute to academic debates in political science and environmental science on the determinants of subnational policy and deforestation, respectively, and have the potential to inform both donors and policymakers about the factors shaping the uneven impact of decentralized arrangements to combat climate change.",1,1,0,1,2,World Development,0,1,Elsevier,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X19300270,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9613598276269505148&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",708,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,79,13.17,40,2,6,https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/cgaray/files/wd_subnational_variation_forest_protection.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:fPpZfrJcaoUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The social context of tropical deforestation involves marginalization of smallfarmers, campesino migration, ethnic mobilization and nascent democratization as processes that affect the legitimacy of institutions and state coercive ability to enforce conservation measures. Competitive social subgroups contest state policies and each other as they strive to gain access rights to natural resources. Central issues in the resolution of natural resource degradation involve land tenure changes, institutional delegitimation, and the role that local normative changes play in a potential pro-conservation future. This cross-national comparative study assesses these variables from the vantage point of five competitive subgroups—the state, commercial interests, smallfarmers, Maya ethnic groups, and non-governmental organizations. Ultimately, successful conservation measures rely on changes in the normative behavior of peasant and Maya communities that enforce land redistribution from below as a component of conservation.

Net of controls for initial forest stock and the quality of deforestation estimates, we find strong evidence for an EKC driven by (1) agglomeration effects linked to the level of urbanization, (2) rural?to?urban migration that partially offsets rural population pressure, (3) the growth of services?dominated urban economies, and (4) strong democratic states.

Our case study, carried out in the Beni department of Bolivia, does not contradict this assertion, but shows that collective rights have been granted in areas where ecological contexts and market facilities were less favourable to intensive land use. Previous experiences suggest investigating political processes in order to understand the criteria according to which access rights were distributed. Based on remote sensing and on a multi-level land governance framework, our research confirms that land placed under collective rights, compared to individual property, is less affected by deforestation among Andean settlements. However, analysis of the historical process of land distribution in the area shows that the distribution of property rights is the result of a political process based on economic, spatial, and environmental strategies that are defined by multiple stakeholders. Collective titles were established in the more remote areas and distributed to communities with lower productive potentialities. Land rights are thus a secondary factor of forest cover change which results from diverse political compromises based on population distribution, accessibility, environmental perceptions, and expected production or extraction incomes.",1,1,0,0,0,Land Use Policy,1,1,Elsevier,2013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837712000440,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15028063950021798470&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",374,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,68,5.67,34,2,12,https://unepgrid.ch/storage/app/media/legacy/15/bolivian_amazon.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:RirnWopojtAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

There is a multitude of empirical studies examining this relationship using various measures of governance and study designs, coming to diverse conclusions. In order to identify the source of variation across studies, this article conducts a meta-analysis of 32 empirical cross-country studies in the field of economics, containing 227 estimates of the impact of different governance measures on deforestation. Using an ordered probit model, we find that the choice of the governance measure is the main factor in explaining variations in the outcomes of the studies. In particular, studies using environmental policy, ownership rights, presence of environmental NGOs, and rule of law as measures of governance, are more likely to find that better governance reduces deforestation. In contrast, studies using democracy and rights as a measure of governance are more likely to find that deforestation increases, when governance is improved.

In order to develop policies that address this significant portion of emissions that contribute to global climate change, it is essential to understand the primary factors driving deforestation in the tropics. This chapter examines the socioeconomic, institutional and economic drivers of tropical deforestation for agriculture in order to gain a better understanding of how incentives to store and sequester carbon in forests may or may not impact deforestation rates. While the circumstances that drive deforestation must be examined within the particular context of each locality and depend upon a variety of factors that include social, political and geographical considerations, there are some general lessons that can be learned from our review of the literature. Government-driven development efforts such as infrastructure development in forested areas, for example, are correlated with deforestation throughout the tropical region. Institutional factors, such as land tenure laws that incentivize forest clearing or macroeconomic policies that provide agricultural subsidies, also influence deforestation rates in a number of tropical countries. In most regions, the factors driving deforestation are complex and interrelated and have significant implications for global climate negotiations where the international community seeks to negotiate a mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+).",1,0,0,0,0,Managing forest carbon in a changing â€¦,0,1,Springer,2011,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_14,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9080399111825524178&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",348,NA,10.1007/978-94-007-2232-3_14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,44,3.14,15,3,14,https://elischolar.library.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=fes-pubs#page=389,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:0gUi1-EOBH4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The interaction is modelled as a cooperative bargaining process and the Nash solution corresponds to the political organisational equilibrium where the interests of all parties, including that of the decision maker are maximised.

Despite this value, tropical deforestation continues at a high rate. Emerging evidence suggests that elections can play an important role in shaping deforestation, for instance by incentivising politicians to allow increased utilisation of forests in return for political support. Nevertheless, the role of elections as driver of deforestation has not yet been comprehensively tested at broad geographic scales. Here, we created an annual database from 2001 to 2018 on political elections and forest loss for 55 tropical nations and modelled the effect of elections on deforestation. In total, 1.5 million km2 of forest was lost during this time period, especially in the Amazon, the Congo Basin and in Southeast Asia. The annual rate of deforestation increased in 37 (67 %) of the analysed countries. Deforestation was significantly lower in years with uncompetitive lower chamber elections compared to competitive election years (i.e. when the opposition can participate in elections and has a legitimate chance to gain governmental power). Our results show a pervasive loss of tropical forests and suggest that competitive elections can be potential drivers of deforestation. Future analyses at higher resolution (intra-annual defores-tation and sub-national governance) and simultaneous collection of data on additional mechanisms (legislative changes, financial investments, and binding term limits) will likely provide additional insights into the impacts of elections. We therefore recommend that organisations monitoring election transparency and fairness should also monitor environmental impacts such as forest loss, habitat destruction and resource exploitation.",1,1,1,1,1,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,0,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,2023,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109832,NA,NA,Article,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109832,0006-3207,NA,279,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience

At least 500,000 additional trees and many miles of vines were cut to make rafts to transport the heavy ebony and rosewood logs. Approximately 36,700 tonnes were shipped in 1,187 containers, almost all to China, for a total export sale price estimated at $ US 220 million. In the SAVA region, members of the timber syndicate pocketed 76% of this whereas the State collected just $ US 15.3 million. Of the three main companies that transported rosewood from Vohemar, Delmas benefited most; three banks also facilitated the illegal timber trade. Fraud is perpetrated by the syndicate and government administrators along every step in Madagascar’s precious timber trade in a coordinated effort to maximize profit and minimize taxes and fines. Poor governance and a lack of clarity in forest regulation have facilitated timber trafficking and undermined judicial control; during at least three periods (1992, 2006 and 2009-2010) escalation of rosewood exportation has been facilitated by government decrees issued prior to elections or during difficult political times, in each instance accompanied by ‘exceptional’government orders allowing a few powerful operators to export massive quantities of wood–all part of a carefully orchestrated cycle.

This article aims to contribute to debates on participation in rural development and environmental conservation, by applying a structure-agency lens to examine experiences of marginal farm households in three distinct systems of resource allocation in Lao PDR’s northern uplands—in other words, three institutional or (in)formal structures. These comprise livelihood development and poverty reduction projects, maize contract farming, and a national protected area. Drawing on qualitative data from focus group discussions and household surveys, the article explores the degree to which farmers may shape their engagement with the different systems, and ways in which agency may be enabled or disabled by this engagement. Our findings show that although some development interventions provide consultative channels for expressing needs, these are often within limited options set from afar. The market-based maize system, while in some ways agency-enabling, also entailed narrow choices and heavy dependence on external actors. The direct regulation of the protected area system meanwhile risked separating policy decisions from existing local knowledge. Our analytical approach moves beyond notions of agency commonly focused on decision-making and/or resistance, and instead revisits the structure-agency dichotomy to build a nuanced understanding of people’s lived experiences of interventions. This allows for fresh perspectives on the everyday enablement or disablement of agency, aiming to support policy that is better grounded in local realities.",1,0,0,0,0,Southeast Asian â€¦,1,1,jstage.jst.go.jp,2019,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/seas/8/2/8_173/_article/-char/ja/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9479068860605679071&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",600,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11,1.83,2,5,6,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/seas/8/2/8_173/_pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:30XeDehqjIMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

They are a major cause of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Their multiple sources are most diverse and root in nature and society. The immediate fire effects directly and the long-term landscape ecosystem degradations indirectly cause major and persisting and serious problems of public health and ecosystem service. Smoke haze from the forest and land fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2015 caused significant environmental and economic losses in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. We describe the different types of land uses and land cover where fires and smoke haze took place, and how local politics have affected fire use from 2001 to 2017. We calculated hot spots from satellite imageries as proxies for fire occurrences and applied regression analysis to understand the link between fire and local politics in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The results show that the greatest frequency of hot spots occurred in wood and oil palm plantations and logging concessions (47%), followed by conservation areas (31%) and community land (22%). Local elections involve land transactions, and fires were used as a cheap way to increase the land value. The use of fire as means of land clearing was strongly influenced by local politics. Their frequency and abundance obviously increased about a year prior to local elections. The reasons behind the correlation need to be understood so that appropriate incentives and sanctions can be put in place and deter political leaders from using fire as an incentive to their advantage.",1,1,0,1,2,INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW,1,0,COMMONWEALTH FORESTRY ASSOC,2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1505/146554819827906799,NA,NA,Article,10.1505/146554819827906799,1465-5489,NA,21,4,486,500,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience

An important debate concerns the levels of governance at which deforestation can be reduced effectively. Political economic theory and evidence suggests that national governments are more likely than subnational governments in agricultural frontiers to adopt restrictive forest conservation policies, due to differences in political constituencies and capacity. Here we examine the validity of this claim using an impact study of provincial-level land use planning in Argentina's main deforestation frontier, the Dry Chaco. In 2007, Argentina's provinces were obliged to define land use zoning for their native forests, but had considerable leeway in its implementation. We use data from 30,126 properties in the provinces of Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Chaco, and a rigorous counterfactual estimation strategy to quantify the extent to which adopted zoning plans affected deforestation. We find evidence that provincial-level land use zoning reduced deforestation in all three provinces, but not in all zones and periods. Differences in impact are associated with differences in the location of zones and the timing of planning.

Across 2253 municipalities, those with higher deforestation see a significant rise in deforestation during federal-and-state election years. Municipal election years raise deforestation for locations with lower deforestation, whereas all of these increases are accentuated when there is party alignment between different levels of government.

Studies on common-pool resources demonstrate that devolution of common property is one of the most important factors for sustainability. This study aims to analyze the factors that influence reducing deforestation and focuses on two different village forest organizations in East Kalimantan: first, village forests under the management of the Forest Management Unit of Berau Barat -forests managed by a provincial government (Long Duhung and Merapun village forests), and second, devolution of village forest managed by a local village institution (Merabu village forest). Recent evidence from these study sites indicates that the devolution of forest management associated with village forests has not consistently reduced forest cover loss. There was a complex interaction between the passage of robustness of the institutional settings and economic preferences linked to deforestation. The forest governance systems, including rules that determine property rights, can promote forest conservation when people's interests are served by forest land use. Conversely, economic preferences also control deforestation. This study confirms that the institutional robustness of forest governance systems and actors' economic preferences play an important role in controlling deforestation. This study suggests the devolution of rights for forest management and incentivizing economic alternatives for using forest resources to reduce deforestation.",1,0,0,0,0,Heliyon,0,1,cell.com,2023,https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(23)03322-4,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5034210558258131296&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",346,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,9,5,4,2,https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440(23)03322-4,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:YDF_kdQb3UUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

This study used qualitative research methods to understand the deforestation and afforestation history of DPRK. Forest cover in the DPRK decreased during the period of Japanese colonisation, increased slightly after liberation, decreased again during the Korean War, increased because of socialist economic progress, and decreased, when Eastern European socialism collapsed after 1990. Between 1990 and 2010, the decrease amounted to 2.2 million ha, while the volume of growing stock continued to decrease by approximately 3% per year. This was due to the copious amounts of fuel wood harvested from forests. Slash-and-burn cultivation of food crops also increased during that time. The decline in forest quantity and quality required comprehensive measures, including favourable international relations, political and institutional reforms, the decentralisation of forest management, and proper technical support for local communities. The forestry issue in DPRK is complex and, therefore, is no longer solely the prerogative of the forestry sector, but is embodied in political, social, cultural, economic, environmental, and other broad development challenges to country faces.

Early stages of new international conservation and development programs, often involving pilot projects designed to test intervention concepts at village level, are characterized by large amounts of resources and attention, along with high expectations of success. However, evidence shows that these early expectations are rarely fulfilled. Despite this repeated pattern and growing engagement with expectations in critical conservation and development literature, little is known about the dynamics of expectations in conservation and development pilot projects. We address this knowledge gap first by exploring concepts from the sociology of expectations. We then unpack expectations in a case study of REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania, using extensive qualitative data reflecting the perspectives and experiences of a wide range of actors involved. Our study finds that expectations play a performative role, mobilizing actors and resources, despite uncertainty identified among policy-makers and practitioners. We also find that once raised, expectations are dynamic and continually mediated by actors and social contexts, which conflicts with attempts to ‘manage’ them. We argue therefore that a trade-off exists between fully piloting new initiatives and raising expectations. We also argue that failure to address this trade-off has implications beyond pilot project objectives and timelines, which are experienced most acutely by village communities. We argue for more critical engagement with expectations and the embedding of accountability for expectations in conservation and development practice. Our findings also challenge the discourse of ‘needing’ to pilot, which prioritizes awareness, impact and innovation without fully considering the potential negative impact of unfulfilled expectations.",0,0,0,0,0,World Development,0,1,Elsevier,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18301542,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=6474742518250539676&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",653,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,102,14.57,26,4,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18301542,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:nApxBATo2lkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Subjects who faced resource scarcity were less cooperative than those who faced more abundant commons condition. When initial condition of the commons was relatively abundant it seemed more likely that resource users established a norm of reciprocity. We further found that especially men overharvested under resource scarcity which is in line with studies that had found men to be more competitive. We also tested different policies. We found that gaining legitimacy through election increases cooperation independent of whether the resource is scarce or abundant. When sanctions were imposed we observed a crowding-out effect of intrinsic motivation to cooperate under resource abundance. With resource scarcity imposed sanctions did not lead to a crowding-out effect but democratic elections were by far more effective.,0,0,0,0,0,Ecological Economics,1,1,Elsevier,2015,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800915001615,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7048126218345813978&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",63,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,48,4.8,16,3,10,https://www.academia.edu/download/111885369/j.ecolecon.2015.04.00520240227-1-hs1wvj.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:2pee-HP5z2EJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Most deforestation is illegal and continues unabated, representing around half of the total deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. Quantifying illegal deforestation is challenging, let alone assessing the social and institutional processes underlying its occurrence. We tackle this challenge by quantifying the relative influence of individual (i.e., landholders’ power, landholding size) and contextual (i.e., subnational institutions, agricultural suitability) factors on the type and size of illegal deforestation in the Argentine Dry Chaco, a major commodity production frontier and global deforestation hotspot. We build a Bayesian network fed with data of 244 illegal deforestation events, obtained from journalistic articles, grey literature, key informant interviews, and geospatial analyses. The results reveal that more powerful landholders were associated with larger illegal deforestation events. Policy simulations suggest that higher concentration of land in the hands of powerful landholders and more flexible subnational forest regulations would escalate illegal deforestation. This points to the need for a smart policy mix that integrates across economic, agricultural, and environmental sectors to halt illegal deforestation at commodity production frontiers. A land tenure reform can facilitate forest protection, while incentives to land-use diversification and the criminal prosecution of illegal deforestation are critical to shift landholder behavior towards more balanced production and conservation outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,Global Environmental â€¦,1,1,Elsevier,2022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378022000498,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=356277099858668891&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",436,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23,7.67,4,6,3,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:W62ueiLA8QQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The Southeast Asian country of Lao PDR is on the brink of a forest transition, that is, a shift from net deforestation to net increases in forest area. This process is, however, contested and this article sheds light to power and politics in forest transitions and the implications for forests and people in Lao PDR and beyond. We develop a conceptual framework rooted in political ecology and critical state theory to identify visions and strategies by institutional actors that aim to transform the forests in particular ways, reflect on their power resources and synthesize three development projects from these strategies. We identify an antecedent dominant extractivist development project, focused on state-led timber extraction and large-scale land acquisitions. We argue that green development strategies that commodify forests through offsetting schemes, results-based payments from REDD+ and industrial tree plantations are increasingly mobilized to complement and modernize this extractivist development trajectory. Whereas these strategies align in their focus on land sparing to intensify agricultural and forest production, on the margins, we carve out an alternative livelihoods-based development project that supports extensive agroecological practices (including shifting cultivation) and integrates forests into multifunctional landscapes, re-centering local interests in reforestation approaches.

There is severe deforestation going on in the lowlands at a rate of approximately 200,000 ha per year, whilst forest degradation mostly concerns montane forests. Cattle ranching is the most important direct driver of deforestation, followed by mechanized agriculture at medium- and large-scale level, mainly for the production of soy bean, and finally small-scale agriculture. Underlying causes of deforestation include, among others, the opening of the agricultural economy to international markets and the weakness of institutions in charge of controlling land use. From 2006 on, under the government of Evo Morales, Bolivia adopted an official position against the marketization of nature and in defense of the rights of mother earth. In consequence to its rejection of REDD, Bolivia developed an alternative proposal called “Joint Mechanism of Mitigation and Adaptation for Integrated and Sustainable Management of Forests and Mother Earth”. This proposal was also promoted in international negotiations on climate change. It focuses on local experiences for a sustainable and integrated management of natural resources and fosters land use planning at different levels of governance. Our analysis suggests that there is still a lack of concrete approaches to mitigate the direct threats to forests; moreover, the control of illegal deforestation is still insufficient. We also note that in parallel to policies of nature conservation, there is a contradicting political agenda being implemented promoting the expansion of the agricultural frontier. Only the future will show if the vision of “Living Well in Harmony with Mother Earth” will really lead to effective measures to combat the loss and the degradation of the immense richness of Bolivian forest.",1,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,books.google.com,2014,https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FRIbBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&ots=C_QatfGs0b&sig=UL_NByBZK2-2kMvhA--PwEDsPdc,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4314905930266265378&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",429,BOOK,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,69,6.27,23,3,11,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a0cb/bbdc77387fc1876871b1953310edb7d43365.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Ike_DBWg4TsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Foresters were but one party to a far-reaching debate (involving architects, doctors, and agronomists) over how best to domesticate heat in the harsh continental climate. By tracing the contours of this debate, this article elucidates the multitude of often-conflicting interests inherent to state-led interventions in household fuel economies: what the author calls the politics of forest conservation in colonial Korea.

Prior to the late 1980s, the Brazilian government represented deforestation of the Amazon as a tool for the attainment of national security. Following the onset of international environmental pressure on Brazil, however, the government moved away from associating deforestation with the provision of security. This alteration in the meaning or discourse of security represented by the Brazilian government is significant for its environmental implications, but also speaks to the political and constructed nature of security. This paper argues that the alteration in the context in which the Brazilian government found itself was central in altering the government's conception of security. This context, determined by a range of interconnected factors and the varying input of a range of actors, forced the Brazilian government to move away from the association of deforestation with the provision of security. The paper concludes by suggesting that future research on the relationship between the environment and security would do well to engage with the way in which questions of security are implicated in instances of environmental change, and to acknowledge the fluid, political and constructed nature of security.",1,0,0,0,0,Contemporary Security Policy,1,0,Taylor &Francis,2003,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13523260312331271919,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12470417505477049393&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",92,NA,10.1080/13523260312331271919,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27,1.23,27,1,22,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:MbzFbqbSD60J:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025&scillfp=10242173378190798604&oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:MbzFbqbSD60J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

It varies strongly across countries and time, and is driven by several idiosyncratic as well as structural factors. Political regime types belong to the latter. Some studies suggest that more democratic countries are associated with lower rates of deforestation, whereas others report that such states might well be related to more clearing of forested land. We contribute to resolving the currently mixed evidence by re-examining, extending, and contextualizing the findings of one of the most recent empirical studies on how democracy affects deforestation. Based on a comprehensive empirical analysis using different data sources and estimation procedures, we show that levels of democracy are linked to deforestation in a U-shaped, curvilinear way: deforestation rates are less strongly pronounced in both the least and the most democratic states, but higher in partial democracies.

Six measures of environmental protection or degradation are examined as the dependent variables, with the independent variables emerging from earlier tests of the impact of the environment on democracy. In the multiple regression analyses of three of the environmental indicators, deforestation, carbon dioxide emission, and soil erosion by water, the statistically significant effect of democracy on the environment actually was negative, contrary to prediction. In the fourth case, protected land area, the impact of democracy was positive while in the remaining two instances, freshwater availability and soil erosion by chemicals, there was no significant effect of democracy on the environment. Other variables such as economic development, agricultural density, European location, age of the polity, and precipitation behaved empirically as one would intuitively expect.

Protection of forested areas provides long-term public goods, while their destruction provides short-term private goods for particular voters. Politicians facing a competitive election offer voters access to forested areas mainly for small-scale farming or commercial use of timber in exchange for electoral support. I test this theory of political deforestation using satellite generated global forest cover data and the results of over 1,000 national-level elections between 1982 and 2016. I find that countries that undergo a democratic transition lose an additional 0.8 percentage points of their forest cover each year, that years with close elections have over 1 percentage point per year higher forest cover loss compared to nonelection years, and that as the margin of victory in an election decreases by 10 points, the amount of deforestation increases by 0.7 percentage points per year. These increases are on the order of 5-10 times the average rate of forest loss globally.

Effective strength depends on the strength of a group, how well it transmits its pressures and the level of public support, all of which are linked to progress in democratization and pluralization. External pressures may change stated policy but not actual policy. Forest policy evolution is divided into three phases: exploitative (when both actual and stated policies promote exploitation), ambiguous (stated policy promotes sustainable management but actual policy remains exploitative) and sustainable management (both actual and stated policies promote sustainable management). The model is tested by applying it to the Philippines, where a sharp rise in the relative power of protectionist groups and their ability to exert pressures on government, and a significant increase in democracy and pluralism, coincided with a major change in forest policy in 1986. Progress in controlling deforestation and managing forest more sustainably throughout the tropics may therefore depend on similar political changes occurring on a larger scale. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Burma has made a transition from 50years of authoritarian rule to what its leaders call 'disciplined democracy'. This paper examines the likely consequences of the Bank's return for the forestry sector in Burma and the potential outcomes in forestry governance given the evolution of its development agenda over the past 25years. While measures to address deforestation have been applied in Southeast Asia, the success of forestry governance reforms depends to a large extent on their endorsement and adoption by local power structures and political figures, as well as on the nature of the political regime itself. The record on forestry governance in Southeast Asia is particularly poor and international financial organizations continue to neglect the local political economy of deforestation. Comparatively, few studies have attempted to investigate the relationship between types of political regimes and rates of deforestation. The paper examines two other new democracies in Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Cambodia), and the impact that governance reforms have had on their deforestation trends and land use, in order to contextualize the potential impact of the WBG's return to Burma. In Southeast Asia, powerful vested interests continue to outweigh the support inside governments or civil society for the forestry governance norms promoted by international organizations. The cases of Indonesia, Cambodia and Burma illustrate that deep patrimonial interests operate within the region and that local politics cannot be ignored by international organizations designing policy reforms.

Consuming countries are increasingly holding transnational businesses accountable for environmental damage on behalf of affected communities in exporting countries. The EU Renewable Energy Directives (RED) and the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) particularly demonstrate such an accountability-by-proxy. Both aim to prevent worldwide deforestation. However, their design and accountability logics vary considerably. Using the case of Indonesia, the article addresses the question of whether a certain accountability relationship matters for improving outcomes such as prevention of tropical deforestation. Hereby, the article contributes to a new theoretical understanding of how logics of proxy accountability are linked to narratives about agency and what inherent normative risks are. The article shows that, different from the EUTR narrative, which reaffirms standard accountability arrangements, RED presents a hybrid approach. This hybrid approach may more effectively prevent tropical deforestation, but it comes at the price of further marginalization of directly affected communities.",1,0,0,0,0,Environmental Politics,0,1,Taylor &Francis,2021,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2020.1793618,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=14159793178207687103&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",415,NA,10.1080/09644016.2020.1793618,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19,4.75,19,1,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lena-Partzsch/publication/343097867_European_Union%27s_proxy_accountability_for_tropical_deforestation/links/67460ac1790d154bf9ada588/European-Unions-proxy-accountability-for-tropical-deforestation.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:v5ERsN-wgcQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The implications of this new scheme for governments, forests, communities and their development are still unclear. The preparation for REDD that is taking place in many countries includes little concern for this mechanism’s potential impacts on the rights and livelihoods of forest-dependent communities who have yet to be consulted. This paper analyzes both precedents and the current process of REDD readiness in Nepal, revealing discrepancies in forest governance that must be addressed before this carbon trading mechanism can successfully meet climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, or development goals. This paper finds that REDD readiness and policy formulation is being driven from the top down, with insufficient involvement and influence by local communities in planning and decision-making processes, and that a more adaptive, bottom-up approach is needed if REDD is to be economically beneficial, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable in the long term.",1,0,0,0,0,Reconsidering Development,0,1,pubs.lib.umn.edu,2010,https://pubs.lib.umn.edu/index.php/reconsidering/article/view/563,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=8814319566668426769&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",681,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21,1.4,21,1,15,https://pubs.lib.umn.edu/index.php/reconsidering/article/download/563/664,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Ee4LFPLAUnoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The services that forests provide enable the forest-dependent people and communities to meet their livelihood needs and well-being. Nevertheless, the world’s forests face a twin environmental problem of deforestation and forest degradation (D&FD), resulting in ubiquitous depletion of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services and eventual loss of forest cover. Ghana, like any tropical forest developing country, is not immune to these human-caused D&FD. This paper reviews Ghana’s D&FD driven by a plethora of pressures, despite many forest policies and interventions to ensure sustainable management and forest use. The review is important as Ghana is experiencing an annual D&FD rate of 2%, equivalent to 135,000 hectares loss of forest cover. Although some studies have focused on the causes of D&FD on Ghana’ forests, they failed to show the chain of causal links of drivers that cause D&FD. This review fills the knowledge and practice gap by adopting the Driver-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) analytical framework to analyse the literature-based sources of causes D&FD in Ghana. Specifically, the analysis identified agriculture expansion, cocoa farming expansion, illegal logging, illegal mining, population growth and policy failures and lapses as the key drivers of Ghana’s D&FD. The study uses the DPSIR analytical framework to show the chain of causal links that lead to the country’s D&FD and highlights the numerous interventions required to reverse and halt the ubiquitous perpetual trend of D&FD in Ghana. Similar tropical forest countries experiencing D&FD will find the review most useful to curtail the menace.",1,0,0,0,0,Forests,0,1,mdpi.com,2021,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/12/4/409,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4635048169821197367&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",201,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,96,24,48,2,4,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/12/4/409,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:N1QEv8D_UkAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Interdisciplinarities, politics, environmentalisms and reduced clearing in Amazonia","from eco-catastrophe to zero deforestation? interdisciplinarities, politics, environmentalisms and reduced clearing in amazonia","Brazil's rate of deforestation has declined by more than 70% since 2004, a dynamic unimaginable even a decade ago. Even the worst drought in more than 100 years (2010) produced a flat clearing profile from 2009–2010, an unexpected result, since dry periods usually have clearing spikes. While deforestation continues throughout the tropics (and Amazonia), and the recent change in Brazil's Forest Code has produced a modest increase in deforestation, there are significant processes that are slowing clearing and fostering woodland recovery. This paper outlines the multiplicities and interdisciplinarities of political ecologies, policies, politics scientific approaches and technologies that have moderated forest conversion and shaped Amazonia's unusual, and unusually effective development and conservation conjunctures in Brazil's post-authoritarian period. New institutional framings, ideologies, political decentralization, globalizations and an expanded arena for new social movements and civil society provided the context for this transformation. Changing environmental institutions, discourses and the relatively redistributive social pact that underpinned President Ignacio (Lula) da Silva's administration had a significant role in promoting more resilient land uses, monitoring, compliance and new markets, while regional social movements and national and international commodity boycotts affected more damaging ones. Finally, other forms of payment for environmental services, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) and REDD+ are changing the value of standing forests. This paper describes how complex interdisciplinarities shaped the politics, policies and practices that slowed forest clearing. However, Amazonia's politics are extremely dynamic: destabilizing processes, violence and indifferent national leadership could still reverse this remarkable turnaround.",0,0,0,0,0,Environmental conservation,1,1,cambridge.org,2012,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/from-ecocatastrophe-to-zero-deforestation-interdisciplinarities-politics-environmentalisms-and-reduced-clearing-in-amazonia/1E19D7F5EE80D16A1FBE1E2CC36C1A6F,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3990315717575278302&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,143,11,143,1,13,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susanna-Hecht/publication/279960956_Environment_Final411/links/559fecaa08ae967fb3e965c4/Environment-Final411.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:3n675wBzYDcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Africa is the only continent in the world where deforestation is on the increase threatening the continent’s scarce water resources, efforts by the region to combat climate change, and exacerbating the vulnerability of rural communities to poverty and effects of climate change. Deforestation over the decades has been blamed on poverty and burgeoning population increase. Demand for wood in Africa which is a source of energy could triple by 2050, straining the continents dwindling forest resources according to UN report. The study based on library research examines the extents to which poor governance and corruption which have been pervasive in Africa and have significantly contributed to the loss of the continent’s forest cover. Thirty published research papers were reviewed with the following objectives; i) analyse the extent of corruption in the forest sector, ii) to examine the extent to which corruption contributes to deforestation in Africa, iii) examine ways in which poor governance and weak institutional arrangements exacerbate corruption in the forest sector, iv) explore the extent to which corruption undermines the effectiveness of Community Forest Associations in combating deforestation in Africa, and v) explore opportunities and challenges of community forest association in combating corruption in the forest sector. The study further evaluated policy documents and frameworks previous researchers have employed to examine forest governance, compared to the emerging recent models of forest governance. From the previous research, it is apparent that corruption has the potential to decimate a nation’s forests. Few studies in Africa have however examined the extent of this phenomenon. There is an urgent need for such studies that provide further explanation on the extent to which corruption plays in the continuing loss of forest cover against the backdrop of all the reforms to improve the performance of the forestry sector.",1,1,1,1,1,NA,1,NA,researchgate.net,2018,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul-Maina-Phd/publication/361024143_Impact_of_Poor_Governance_on_Deforestation_in_Africa/links/629868f2416ec50bdb03fcd8/Impact-of-Poor-Governance-on-Deforestation-in-Africa.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9043237846861602733&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",108,PDF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,0.86,3,2,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul-Maina-Phd/publication/361024143_Impact_of_Poor_Governance_on_Deforestation_in_Africa/links/629868f2416ec50bdb03fcd8/Impact-of-Poor-Governance-on-Deforestation-in-Africa.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:rd-NmegIgH0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

This article develops a theoretical framework by adapting governmentality to deliberative democracy and then analyses how participation and engagement are used as powerful tools to govern the introduction of REDD +. The framework is applied to two sub-national REDD+ initiatives, the Central Sulawesi Pilot Province and the Kalimantan Forest and Climate Partnership. The engagement and participatory forums employed in these cases operate to alter and discipline the activities of local agents who regulate, manage and use forestry resources. They provide a political space to introduce new knowledge and external narratives on appropriate and legitimate ways to govern land-use development. As a highly managed post-political domain they enable contested issues around forests to be debated and potentially resolved, but within a prescribed managerial framework focussed on carbon mitigation. Through engagement and discursive interaction the multiple landholders, communities, businesses and government agencies are activated as subjects and citizens of these new carbon based endeavours.

Despite the length of time that these policy experiments have been in force, there is little agreement about their effectiveness. We argue that part of this ambivalence stems from three limitations of extant studies, suggesting that future studies of decentralized natural resource governance should consider a combination of 1) variation in the local institutional context, 2) the fit between the reform and other public policies, and 3) more adequate outcome measures for decentralized resource governance. After developing such an approach, we posit that varying forest conditions depend on the moderating effects that local institutions have on the socioeconomic and biophysical drivers of environmental change. Analyzing data from interviews and remotely sensed images from 30 municipalities in the Bolivian lowlands, we find that the local institutional performance affects unauthorized deforestation directly and indirectly, but detect no effects on either permitted or total deforestation. © 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management",1,0,1,1,2,Journal of Policy Analysis and â€¦,1,1,Wiley Online Library,2007,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pam.20229,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15822786566148235702&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",361,NA,10.1002/pam.20229,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,198,11,99,2,18,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:tqEWmIzUldsJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025&scillfp=989776468588476793&oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:tqEWmIzUldsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The results show that although the median voter has a strong preference for conservation, local political competition causally increases deforestation, especially in municipalities with private commercial interests that deforestation. I argue that in shortening time horizons, political competition encourages Brazilian mayor to engage in the strategic non-enforcement of environmental standards to cater to such vested interests.

This paper identifies the spatial driving forces (SDFs) of deforestation in the CDR for 1975–2000 using satellite data of 1975 (MSS), 1990 (TM), and 2000 (ETM+) along with socio-demographic and socioeconomic variables. Radiometrically calibrated satellite images are individually classified into seven distinct classes and merged together to cover the entire CDR. Classification accuracies are also assessed. Areas of land use and cover within the areas of each Village Development Committee (VDC) and municipality represented by GIS polygons are calculated from the classified images by overlaying vector files of 1845 polygons representing sections of VDCs and municipalities in 30–1199m, 1200–2399m, 2400–4999m and >5000m elevation levels. These elevation levels were estimated from the DEM compiled from 24 ASTER scenes taken on different dates. Only the first three elevation levels are used in the analysis because area >5000m is under permanent snow cover where human related forestry activities are almost negligible. A transition matrix is generated for 1975–1990 using classified images of 1975 and 1990 and then this product is used to further develop another transition matrix for 1990–2000 with the classified ETM+ 2000 images as the final stage. The GIS polygon layer is overlaid on the transition matrices to calculate deforestation areas for 1975–1990 and 1990–2000. Biophysical and socioeconomic information collected from various sources is then brought into a GIS platform for statistical analyses. Six linear regression models are estimated using SAS; in effect, two models for each elevation range representing the 1975–1990 and 1990–2000 periods of change to identify SDF influences on deforestation. These regression analyses reveal that deforestation in the CDR is related to multiple factors, such as farming population, genders of various ages, migration, elevation, road, distance from road to forest, meandering and erosion of river, and most importantly the conversion of forestland into farmland.",0,0,0,0,0,Journal of Environmental Management,0,1,Elsevier,2009,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479709003107,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16116184934302266965&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",312,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,80,5,27,3,16,https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=nsc_research,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:VbaWf88wqN8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

After three years of denying and dismantling the public apparatus to fight Amazon deforestation, this is emblematic of how transparency and social participation have been neglected. Transparency of PRODES has been crucial to all initiatives against deforestation. Notwithstanding, the Brazilian government has not only worked to discredit PRODES, but limited access to other environmental data and decreed a ‘gag law’. Responses to requests of public data are largely unsatisfactory and information on deforestation permits (key to understanding the extent of legal and illegal deforestation) is either missing or incomplete. Social participation has been strongly limited after one-fifth of 22 national boards monitoring the public administration was extinct and almost half restructured. As an outcome, the Amazon Fund, the most important source of financial support against deforestation, was frozen.

Today, the impacts of deforestation continue to impinge on livelihoods of rural and urban dwellers, disrupting important environmental functions and severely destroying forest ecosystems. Some studies have analyzed factors that influence deforestation in Ghana. However, none have placed emphasis on the occurrence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for deforestation in Ghana. This study employs the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bounds Testing approach to cointegration to empirically investigate the factors that cause deforestation in the long and short run as well as investigating the occurrence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for deforestation using time series data from 1970 and 2009. The long run estimation results indicate that variables such as urbanization, rural population pressure, globalization, Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), and agricultural technology affect deforestation in Ghana positively, while agricultural production index, forest exports value as a percentage of GDP, enforcement of property right and forest protection and exchange rate influence deforestation negatively. The impact of total external debt on deforestation Ghana was positive but not significant implying a weak confirmation of the Debt Resource Hypothesis in Ghana. Analysis of the EKC for deforestation in Ghana indicate that the phenomenon is real in Ghana with the per capita income turning point being at $ US 364.99 (in constant 2000 $ US) which will occur in 2011 at a deforestation rate of 1.5%.

Yet, studies of democratization and neoliberalism tend to remain separate, failing to recognize their complex interconnections, both in their material and discursive dimensions. At the heart of this dissertation research is the question of how these interconnections are manifested in the environments of urban sub-Saharan Africa. The dissertation examines the role that combined processes of implementing neoliberal adjustment programs and electoral democratization in Kenya played in the deforestation of Karura and Oloolua forest reserves. The forest reserves are located in Nairobi, the nation's commercial and political capital. Both forests underwent accelerated loss of trees and land in the 1990s, a period during which state elites were grappling with early phases of neoliberal reform and electoral democratization in the country. Additionally, the dissertation examines responses from various civil society groups and individuals to the issue of deforestation. Ideas in urban political ecology, debates around relationships between the environment and both processes of democratization and neoliberal economic reform, and discussions of collective action arising from civil society and social movements inform the analysis in this dissertation. The dissertation draws from interviews and discussions conducted with state and city officials, key individuals of various civil society groups, and ordinary Nairobi residents. The dissertation also considers relevant print materials. This study concludes that the realities of electoral democracy and neoliberal economic reform in Kenya complicate simplistic views of the interactions between democratization and neoliberalism. The study argues that the pressure to satisfy donors with a neoliberal agenda, in combination with the pressure to raise funds to compete in a multiparty election, led state elites to sell and develop the public forests to reserve their power, under the pretense of privatization and reform.",1,1,0,0,0,NA,1,1,search.proquest.com,2008,https://search.proquest.com/openview/e9ff0784a59b4c21dfb2e3945f176f76/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10346437388209646064&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",43,BOOK,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0.06,1,1,17,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:8GkOn_ztlY8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

In such projects the ‘participation’ of the ‘community’ in forest conservation has become the new orthodoxy. However, proposals about local people's participation presume that defining the future of the forest is a straight contest between the alternatives of conservation or forest clearing. Such proposals also presume that the existence of communities is non-problematic. In contrast, this article documents that there is already considerable local debate about forest use and conservation, much of it among those excluded from the formal arena of politics and policy-making. Concern with ‘the environment’ includes concern about the perpetuation of society, and represents a clear continuation of West African village cosmologies focused on the societalisation of space. At the same time, conservation aims of ‘keeping the forest as it is’ have few resonances, since forest people see society itself as an artful, but often problematic, construction in which the conversion of the forest plays a central part.

A 22-year time series of classified Landsat images was used to evaluate deforestation and forest regeneration in riparian permanent preservation areas over the past two decades, focusing on the municipality of Paragominas in the state of Pará in eastern Amazonia. There was no evidence that riparian forests had been more effectively protected than non-riparian forests. Instead, deforestation was found to be comparatively higher inside riparian permanent preservation areas as recently as 2010, indicating a widespread failure of private property owners to comply with environmental legislation.

As a widely agreed framework they offer a potential way to mobilise stakeholders on a global scale. The manner in which the goals, with time-based targets and specific metrics, are set out within a voluntary reporting process adopted by both governments and business, provides a fascinating and important case for organisational studies. It is both about advancing performance measurement and evidence-based policy-making for sustainable development, and also participation and consultation at a wider, more global scale, than has ever been possible before. This paper contributes to the notion of SDGs as a wicked problem, answering calls for deeper theorisation, via synthesis with core ideas in the management field of decision theory. A case study on the wicked problem of deforestation and its links to supply chains, multi-stakeholder initiatives and SDG reporting, provides an illustration of the relevance of the application of decision theory to wicked problems, presented using a novel conceptual framework.

This paper presents the results of a novel analytical-deliberative engagement process that brings together stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples in participatory workshops in the interior and coastal regions of British Columbia (BC) to evaluate a set of potential forest carbon mitigation alternatives. In particular, this study examines what objectives are prioritized by stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples when discussing forest carbon mitigation in BC’s forests, as well as the perceived effectiveness of, and levels of support for, six forest-based carbon mitigation strategies. We start by describing the methodological framework involving two series of workshops. We then describe the results from the first round of workshops where participants identified 11 objectives that can be classified into four categories: biophysical, economic, social, and procedural. Afterwards, we discuss the second series of workshops, which allowed participants to evaluate six climate change mitigation strategies against the objectives previously identified, and highlight geographical differences, if any, between BC’s coastal and interior regions. Our results effectively illustrate the potential and efficacy of our novel methodology in informing a variety of stakeholders in different regions, and generating consistent results with a surprising degree of consensus on both key objectives and preference for mitigation alternatives.

190,paper_42,40,F.M. Pelicice,A political tsunami hits Amazon conservation,a political tsunami hits amazon conservation,"The history of conservation of the Amazon can be viewed as a war involving many battles with interests in agribusiness on one side and in biodiversity conservation and sustainability on the other side. Trends in large?scale deforestation in the 1970s spurred a series of policies, stakeholder alliances and international and grass?roots movements, which decades later led to the establishment of protected areas and interventions in soy and beef supply chains of agribusiness. Together, these advances epitomized a conservation framework for the Amazon, which at one point nearly curbed deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, although it included very few protections for freshwater ecosystems.
While those conservation advances were taking place, however, a series of policy changes started to undermine them through expansions in deforestation, river regulation and mining activities. The election of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro in 2019 then hit the Amazon conservation framework much like a tsunami of policy setbacks and the re?establishment of the economic policies that sparked the Amazon war in the past.
The current trajectory is one of large?scale degradation of Amazonian ecosystems and biodiversity with consequent impacts on local people. Because freshwater ecosystems are highly sensitive to human activities on water and on land, these growing impacts are particularly large.
It is too early to know, but four decades of institutional and policy developments to conserve the Brazilian Amazon may soon be pushed past the point from which they will be able to recover. Four conditions will be pivotal to allowing the Amazon conservation framework to recoup: (a) the end of Bolsonaro’s mandate in 2022 or earlier; (b) remobilization of stakeholders; (c) investments in environmental research, policy and multiple collaborations; and (d) moving conservation beyond terrestrial landscapes to also encompass freshwater ecosystems and their people.",0,0,0,0,0,Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems,0,1,NA,2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103199143&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85103199143&origin=inward,8,Article,10.1002/aqc.3565,1052-7613,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103199143,31,5,1221,1229,40,10,40,1,4,NA,NA,scopus

Our objective is to provide an essential foundation to the policy reform process that is underway in Nepal and many other Asian countries. The review shows that before 1957 the Nepalese government’s focus was on conversion of forestlands to farmlands, and extraction of timber for export. After the nationalisation of the forests in 1957 until 1976, policy-making efforts were oriented towards national control of forests through stringent laws and expansion of the forest bureaucracy. This approach failed as evidenced by widespread deforestation and forest degradation across the country during the 1960s through 1980s. Early efforts of the government and donor agencies to rectify the problem through reforestation and afforestation also largely failed, but these efforts paved the way for subsequent initiation of the participatory approach to forest management in the late 1970s. Since then, community-based forest management evolved continuously under the aegis of supportive forest policies and legislations. The present community forestry program has met with notable successes in some areas. However, the program has been confronted with some contentious issues in recent years including a policy debate over the suitability of forests in the southern lowlands (the terai) for community management and sharing of income obtained from community forests. These and some other issues surrounding the community forestry program are discussed and their implications for designing or improving future forest governance have been identified.",1,0,0,0,0,International forestry â€¦,1,1,ingentaconnect.com,2004,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cfa/ifr/2004/00000006/00000002/art00005,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4638581830144150175&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",895,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,290,13.81,97,3,21,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ganesh-Shivakoti/publication/242661877_A_Review_of_Forest_Policies_Institutions_and_Changes_in_the_Resource_Condition_in_Nepal/links/0deec534b28aaccc17000000/A-Review-of-Forest-Policies-Institutions-and-Changes-in-the-Resource-Condition-in-Nepal.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:n8pSJ5mNX0AJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

I argue that this campaign was, by its nature, propagandistic, for it created a narrative of a deforested China before 1949 and a greener land after 1949 to serve the purpose of justifying China's new political system and popularizing socialist ideologies. Hence, such projects helped to define what socialism was in China and thereby solicited the participation of the general population. This afforestation project, engineered to legitimize the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) rule in China both domestically and internationally, was, however, marred by both human and non-human actors. Local inhabitants who were intent upon protecting their own private properties vis-à-vis the collectivizing state, poachers who illegally felled trees for firewood and timber, and tea growers who were keen on expanding their tea plantations at the cost of mountain forests sabotaged the CCP's afforestation efforts. Meanwhile, various pests contributed to the massive death of newly planted trees and prompted local cadres and citizens to adjust afforestation policies throughout Mao's times.

Land reform tends to promote land redistribution through regularization of smallholder land invasions of large-scale landholdings, and by redistribution of public lands to smallholders in existing colonization frontiers. The implications of state-led land reform on deforestation are heterogeneous. I argue that impacts of agrarian reform are strongly related to the pre-existing social and economic configuration of the frontiers where it takes place. While it leads to lower rates of deforestation in landscapes dominated by smallholders with diversified land use, its impact on forest conversion is higher in landscapes where extensive land use, mainly prompted by large-scale cattle ranching, tends to dominate.

We investigate the impact of the massive epidemic of coffee leaf rust (CLR) that affected Mexico from 2012 on deforestation. CLR is a fungal disease that negatively affects coffee production. We exploit the gradual spread of the epidemic across coffee?growing municipalities and estimate a difference?in?differences model. We find that deforestation increased by 32% in CLR?affected municipalities, but we find no increase in agricultural land. We find evidence of deforestation in cropland area, and our effects are driven by states where rustic coffee systems were predominant. These results suggest that deforestation occurred within coffee cultivation areas and point out the concurrent role of government subsidies and incentives through the PROCAFE program, launched in 2014, that promoted the replacement of traditional coffee trees by CLR?resistant hybrids. We study the dynamic effects of CLR and exploit the delayed launch of PROCAFE to try to disentangle the impact of the epidemic from that of the policy response.

197,paper_89,0,CM Ouellette,AMAZONIAN CONQUESTS AND THE POLITICS OF DEFORESTATION,amazonian conquests and the politics of deforestation,"A recent New York Times publication reported on the relationship between deforestation in the Amazon and a policy shift from Brazil’s recently elected President Dilma Rousseff (Barrionuevo 2012). The article underscored recent advances in preservation, noting that deforestation in Brazil had successfully slowed over the past ten years. Yet environmental activists are now contending with a provision allowing Rousseff to reduce the land set aside for conservation, testing the Forest Code enacted forty seven years ago. International pressure faces Brazil’s Congress as Rio de Janeiro prepares to host the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development this summer. Agriculture accounts for twenty two percent of Brazil’s Gross Domestic Product, and thus the pressure to continue developing while also protecting the rainforest is immense. In the popular imaginary, the debate between conservation and land use is reduced to the question of protectionism at the expense of negative global climate change.
After several waves of environmentalism locally, nationally, and internationally, scholarship emerging from and on Latin American environmental issues has accelerated at the end of the twentieth century and into the twentyfirst century. Inspired in part by increased international interest in conservation due to global climate change, awareness of environmental crises has also risen because of Brazil’s prominent role as a leading economic power during this ongoing global economic crisis. The country has been thrust into the international public eye as it prepares to host the FIFA World Cup in 2014, and Rio de Janeiro will welcome Olympians in 2016.

International stakeholders are heavily involved in Indonesian forest policies, including in the issue of deforestation, both because of their immense interest in the Indonesian environment, and because of Indonesia’s lack of development capacity. Many of domestic and international stakeholders participating in the policy-making processes with regard to Indonesian forests have discrete views and concerns. A successful policy would be one that meets all the requirements of all such actors. This study was conducted to analyze the policy process including some questions about Indonesia’s policies for the prevention of deforestation: 1. ‘When are such policies formed?’, 2. ‘Who is involved in the policy-making process?’, 3. How are the resulting policies implemented?’ Appropriate research methods and analysis frameworks for the examination of policy processes were developed for this study and were applied to Indonesia’s deforestation prevention policies.

This study aimed to investigate endogenous variables namely, economic development and deforestation, in North Sumatra, and examine their determinants. Both variables are substantial in a country community welfare with harmonized environmental sustainability as a legacy for future generations.
METHODS
In this quantitative study, secondary data in the form of time series data from 1991 to 2020 with a total of 30 years were analyzed. The novelty of this study is its aim to combine deforestation variables and their determinants in a research model related to economic development. In this study, the determinants of economic development used were education, health, mineral resources and forest resource, whereas those of deforestation, were forest resource, institutional factors, population density, and economic development.
FINDINGS
The data analysis revealed that the economic development in North Sumatra was significantly influenced by education, health, and mineral resources, excluding forest resources. Simultaneously, the determinants influenced economic development by 74.15 percent. Education contributed 27 percent, health 71 percent, mineral resources 12 percent and forest resources 29 percent to economic development. Forest resources and institutions had a significant influence on deforestation in North Sumatra, whereas population density and economic development did not have a significant effect. Simultaneously, the determinants influenced deforestation by 77.24 percent. Partial, forest resources and institutions were identified and significant effect but population density does not significantly affect it. Forest resources contributed 14 percent to deforestation, institutional factors 72 persent, population density 3 percent and economic development 57 percent.
CONCLUSION
The findings of this study, indicated that education and health have a major effect on economic development whereas forest resources do not however, forest resources significantly affect deforestation. This means that an increasing environmental damage removes forest cover. Thus, it is recommended that the government increase human resource in terms of education and health, which are essential in prioritizing human resource development as a fundamental factor. It is also important to set the limit to long-term natural resource exploitation, consider environmental damages, and improve institutional quality. The government needs to explore alternative sources that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly, such as ecotourism, and renewable energy. Renewable energy can be a reliable source of energy that will help reduce reliance on fossil fuels while also minimizing environmental impacts.",0,0,0,0,0,Glob J Environ Sci Manag,0,1,sid.ir,2023,https://www.sid.ir/fileserver/je/1823-279870-x-1135714.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=14211732188455251629&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",96,PDF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,4.5,3,3,2,https://www.sid.ir/fileserver/je/1823-279870-x-1135714.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:rS7c3yA3OsUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Here we systematically catalog whether second-tier governments in 30 tropical countries with high projected future emissions from deforestation possess 14 distinct types of general and forest-related authority. We compile this information in a free, open-access database. Second-tier governments have broadest authority to reduce deforestation in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Peru, China, Laos, Mozambique, and Vietnam. Second-tier governments have the least authority in Central African Republic, Gabon, Angola, Madagascar, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Venezuela. Second-tier governments have intermediate authority in Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Mexico, the Philippines, Colombia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Zambia, Mexico, and Republic of Congo. Authorities that second-tier governments most commonly possess include development planning, taxation, budgeting, and roads. Authorities that second-tier governments least commonly possess include land ownership, police, permits for mining, Indigenous affairs, and protected areas. Authorities possessed by an intermediate number of second-tier governments include spatial planning, elections, courts, and permits for agriculture. More than one-quarter of future emissions from deforestation between 2020 and 2050 is projected to come from just seven out of 678 second-tier jurisdictions: Amazonas, Para, and Mato Grosso (Brazil), equateur and Orientale (Democratic Republic of Congo), Loreto (Peru), and El Beni (Bolivia). After weighting for authority, our list of the 50 second-tier jurisdictions in the tropics that are the highest priority for reducing emissions from deforestation shifts to include fewer second-tier jurisdictions in Africa (where second-tier governments have 4.2 authorities out of 14 in the average country) and Latin America (6.3 authorities out of 14) and more second-tier jurisdictions in Asia (8.5 authorities out of 14). Second-tier jurisdictions that have formally expressed interest in reducing emissions from deforestation, e.g., through the Governors' Climate and Forest Task Force, Under2 Coalition, or New York Declaration on Forests, possess greater authority to reduce deforestation on average than other jurisdictions.

Industrial pollution of urban air and waterways, rapid and often illegal deforestation, and damage to marine resources and habitats all come to mind, and all have attracted critical attention. Yet among these nontraditional threats to security, few have been more widely noted than the perennial smoke that still rises from fires in Indonesia and spreads to neighboring countries. As I shall show in this chapter, these fires and the resulting haze have triggered a long series of responses from ASEAN. Yet the flames and smoke have reappeared, to varying extents and intensities, for more than the last fifteen years. Off and on, the haze has threatened health in parts of Malaya, Sarawak, Kalimantan, Sumatra, Brunei Darussalam, and Singapore. The Philippines and Thailand have been affected to a lesser degree. On occasion, local air has been rendered toxic enough to force the closing of schools. Affected areas have lost billions of dollars in health costs and canceled hours. No wonder ASEAN has labeled the haze “the most serious problem in the region.” 2 Originating as it does in one country, while damaging livelihoods in adjacent countries, the haze deserves the attention of anyone interested in regional approaches to environmental security. Of additional interest is how political accountability inside one country—democratic Indonesia—may have hurt or helped its ecological accountability to the larger region. There are many reasons to criticize the lack of environmental protection in Southeast Asia, from rapid and often illegal deforestation to overfishing and the pollution of urban air and waterways.

Examining actors' perceptions, we comparatively analyze two cases, in two Brazilian states with contrasting contexts. We conclude that territorial planning MSFs are highly political spaces influenced by complexities in context, power relations, and communities' diversity.

Impact of Leftist Mayors on Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon,can the political left save the rainforests? impact of leftist mayors on deforestation in the brazilian amazon,"The paper argues that Brazil’s political left, traditionally aligned with various workers’
groups, tends to prioritize environmental protection and the rights of indigenous people, who are
disproportionately represented among the poor in the legal Amazon. This inclination stems from the
left's preference for state intervention to safeguard the indigenous population, which often conflicts with
business interests in agriculture, cattle ranching, and mining in the legal Amazon. Using satellite
monitoring data from 760 municipalities in the Brazilian legal Amazon region between 2000 and 2021,
the study examines the influence of left-wing mayors on levels and rates of deforestation, annual
deforestation changes, reforestation initiatives, and local government spending on environmental
management. Through a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach, the study assesses the impact of leftwing mayors who narrowly defeated right-wing rivals in close elections. The results suggest that
electing a leftist mayor in a tight race leads to significant reductions in annual changes in deforestation,
increased reforestation, and higher environmental expenditures, particularly when the leftist mayors
govern without a coalition. These effects persist regardless of whether the mayors belong to the left
alone, a left and centre-left coalition, or workers’ parties, with the strongest impact seen among mayors
solely from the left. The study also documents that municipalities with larger indigenous populations
and higher levels of deforestation are more likely to elect leftist mayors, resulting in increased leftist
vote shares. This dynamic holds leftist mayors accountable to these voters and underscores the
importance of a functioning local democracy.",1,1,1,1,1,NA,1,1,researchgate.net,2024,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarmistha-Pal-2/publication/370188448_Can_the_Political_Left_Save_the_Rainforests_Impact_of_Leftist_Mayors_on_Deforestation_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon/links/66e5ff3ba438c86fdcceca21/Can-the-Political-Left-Save-the-Rainforests-Impact-of-Leftist-Mayors-on-Deforestation-in-the-Brazilian-Amazon.pdf,NA,15,PDF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,2,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarmistha-Pal-2/publication/370188448_Can_the_Political_Left_Save_the_Rainforests_Impact_of_Leftist_Mayors_on_Deforestation_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon/links/66e5ff3ba438c86fdcceca21/Can-the-Political-Left-Save-the-Rainforests-Impact-of-Leftist-Mayors-on-Deforestation-in-the-Brazilian-Amazon.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:JI7Nu-7FgjsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Forests are essential for life on earth. Three hundred million people worldwide live in forests and 1.6 billion depend on them for their livelihoods. Forests also provide habitat for a vast array of plants and animals, many of which are still undiscovered. Aarey Colony is located adjacent to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the only national park in the world within the city limits of a metropolis. Not only is this forest rich in biodiversity, but it is also home to the Adivasi community who have been living here for generations. This community has borne the brunt of development projects which ended up displacing them and packing them into matchbox-sized, inconvenient Slum Rehabilitation Authority buildings.
Methodology
A study was conducted to understand the impact of deforestation in the Aarey Forest has had on Katakari, Warli and Kokna tribes were selected in our research and what they feel about the phenomenon of such a kind of deforestation. The method followed for data collection was through the discussion with the local people and personal interviews. The information was collected by people through a questionnaire.
Results
From the study it was understood that due to the deforestation in the Aarey Forest there has been observed a rise in the extinction of endangered species, increase in heat, flooding during monsoon, and majorly affected rainfall. Apart from the massive deforestation, FORCE 1 and the developing film city and resorts are the major reasons for tree felling in the region.
Conclusion
With collaboration with the local residents, NGO’s and experts in the field we can spread awareness about the importance of the prevailing issue and further take this to a greater advocacy level focusing on the responsibility of the govt. and a citizen as a whole.",0,0,0,0,0,National Journal of Professional Social â€¦,0,1,pswjournal.org,2021,http://pswjournal.org/index.php/njpsw/article/view/290,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1071572581270890445&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",138,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0.5,1,3,4,https://pswjournal.org/index.php/njpsw/article/download/290/31,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:zSez0ZX93g4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

We characterized these changes through a meta?analysis of case studies of land?cover change in the tropics. From the 1960s to the 1980s, small?scale farmers, with state assistance, deforested large areas of tropical forest in Southeast Asia and Latin America. As globalization and urbanization increased during the 1980s, the agents of deforestation changed in two important parts of the tropical biome, the lowland rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia. Well?capitalized ranchers, farmers, and loggers producing for consumers in distant markets became more prominent in these places and this globalization weakened the historically strong relationship between local population growth and forest cover. At the same time, forests have begun to regrow in some tropical uplands. These changing circumstances, we believe, suggest two new and differing strategies for biodiversity conservation in the tropics, one focused on conserving uplands and the other on promoting environmental stewardship in lowlands and other areas conducive to industrial agriculture.",1,0,0,0,0,Conservation â€¦,0,1,Wiley Online Library,2009,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01332.x,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3551075778907855959&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",95,NA,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01332.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,833,52.06,208,4,16,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/15944/stri_Rudel_et_al_Debate_2009.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:V9xLRJv0RzEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The Grain for Green is the largest of these programs, in terms of area covered, people affected, and money invested. This book only reviews the Grain for Green, but in many villages more than one program was introduced concurrently. In this chapter, we argue that the government introduced the KFPs not only because environmental deterioration had reached a critical point, but also because China was producing a surplus of grain, which lowered farmers’ incomes, and because inequality between the eastern and western provinces was reaching a critical point. The Grain for Green in particular addressed all these problems concurrently, through direct payments to poor farmers willing to set aside marginal land.

This article focuses on the local institutions chosen as partners by a prominent REDD+ project in Kenya and the implications of this choice for local democracy. The REDD+ project briefly partnered with state-appointed local authorities to represent local interests, bypassing elected ones. Shortly after, the state-appointed authorities were abandoned in favour of 'project-created' carbon committees and civil society organisations. The choice to recognise some institutions while excluding others, was justified by the levels of downward accountability and of corruption, and arguments that state-sanctioned institutions were overburdened and inefficient. However, the article contends that this preference for carbon committees and civil society organisations over state-sanctioned institutions, and particularly the aversion to democratically elected ones, was not conducive for long-term strengthening of local democracy. The analysis pinpoints a tension between setting up parallel models of authority that can act as exemplars of democratic practice, while undermining democratically elected institutions that, in Kenya, are struggling to exercise newly devolved powers.

Each time the government took steps to execute the Mabira project, civil society groups organised large-scale protests that pressurised the government into shelving its plans. The Save Mabira Forest campaign has been widely cited as an example of how sustained protests by civil society groups serve as a corrective of democratic deficits in decision-making processes pertaining to the commons and as a deterrent to profit-driven business schemes hatched in collusion with carefree or corrupt bureaucrats and politicians. However, an in-depth analysis of the campaign suggests that ecological and social justice concerns are mixed up with identity politics and exclusionist agendas.

The United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD Programme) supports developing countries adopting REDD+, and commits to strengthen local democracy as a safeguard such that REDD+ benefits to local people are not captured by elites. The chapter questions whether the UN-REDD funded Nigeria-REDD program meets this safeguard requirement. Research methods included literature review, semi-structured interviews, focus group meetings and participant observation. The study finds that the design of Nigeria-REDD was not inclusive of democratically elected local government authority. The UN-REDD approved the Nigeria-REDD proposal, trusting that NGOs who were involved in designing Nigeria-REDD, will push for democratic governance. However, NGOs do not have a mandate to democratically respond to the needs of local people.

However, less attention has been devoted to the role of the social cognitive capital of the national population. Does society's cognitive capital matter in governmental choice regarding environmental policies, if at all? This study addresses this question through a large-N analysis of 94 countries accounting for the role of both political regimes and social capital in governmental choice of climate change policies. We find that higher social cognitive capital within a democratic state radically increases that state's commitment to adopt environmental policies. More specifically, a 1-point increase in the democracy index is associated with nearly 5 points increase in the adoption of the Climate Laws, Institutions and Measures Index (CLIMI). In a similar vein, a 10 points increase in social cognitive capital is associated with a nearly 16 points increase in CLIMI. The findings presented in this study aim to contribute to the ongoing debate on the impact of democracy and the cognitive capital of society on international environmentalism. The findings will also be interesting for scholars working on the impact of political institutional factors and the role of society in environmental policy choices made at the international level.ù",0,0,0,0,0,Environmental research,1,1,Elsevier,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935117306382,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17014678158916424613&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",577,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,82,10.25,41,2,8,https://www.academia.edu/download/106910786/87630.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:pZPPTaNHIOwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

In line with this school of thought, and new generations of studies on environmental crime, this work aims to present the environmentally and climate-related issues arising from land degradation in the Peruvian Amazon; focusing on those casual mechanisms developed from the collusion between Peruvian-economic policies and new private actors such as transnational corporations (TNCs). Relying on the assumption that: the processes moving the issue of climate change overcome the global space, and can be observed from regional, national or local point of view; this work's purpose is to analyze how a single country as Peru, currently considered of low ecological footprint, could, by means of the definition of national laws (environmentally and economic-related) burden climate change. The analysis focuses on a single case-study identified with the territory within the Northern Ucayali and Southern Loreto regions in Peru, and builds on the theory of state-corporate crime developed in the 1990s by Ronald C. Kramer and Raymond J. Michalowski to define the role of state-corporate relationships in the production of social harms. To show how this relationship is today shaping the globally spread issue of climate change, the analysis of the palm oil industry in Ucayali is presented as main example of a broader phenomenon of transgression and partnership between private and public spheres in Peru. In this optic, the purpose is to give further contributions to the studies of climate change as state-corporate crime, focusing on the analysis of those territory, as the Amazon, whose preservation has been identified as mayor tool against global warming and which is instead harmed by the relation between private and governments interests.",0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,diva-portal.org,2017,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1108196,NA,768,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,8,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1108196/FULLTEXT01.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:ptFwnrvLhykJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

This thesis investigates a forest planting project in the rural south of Malawi. Small scale farmers were ordered to abstain from cultivating their gardens on a mountain, as the whole mountainside land was designated to forest planting. The forest project hence turned into a conflict over land. It can be considered a collective action problem, because each individual farmer would be better off with continued cultivation on his own garden, while the community as a whole suffered from severe soil erosion due to the deforested mountain. In the long term, everybody would be better off with a forested mountain. The results of this collective action problem differed in the villages surrounding the mountain. In some villages, farmers were convinced to cooperate in the forest project, and the communities were rewarded with a valuable forest resource benefiting all inhabitants. Other villages failed, and today suffer from increasing problems of soil erosion. The main question of this thesis is why and how some villages reached the collectively successful results, while others did not. What were the differences between these villages and how may these differences have resulted in completely different outcomes in the forest project? I analyse the decision faced by individual farmers of whether to contribute their land to the forest project or not. It is assumed that specific circumstances within the villages have affected the individual decisions and thus determined the success or failure of the forest project. The empirical analysis is based on qualitative data collected during two months of fieldwork in the villages in 2007, with a focus on interviews and observations. The fieldwork revealed two main factors behind successful collective action; (1) a social norm supporting general co-operative behaviour, and (2) formal punishment of defectors, in a case in which the social norm was not strong enough to convince farmers of co-operation. Both regulations increase farmers’ incentives to co-operate, and thus contribute to preserve the common pool resource.",0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,duo.uio.no,2008,https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/17504,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7000021098156065578&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",677,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0.06,1,1,17,https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/17504/2/oppgave03.06.08.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:KgPV3xkSJWEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Using satellite data, we test the effect of property rights on deforestation between 1982 and 2016. In order to identify causal effects, we combine a regression discontinuity design with the orthogonal timing of homologation. We find that observations inside territories with full property rights show a significant decrease in deforestation, while the effect does not exist in territories without full property rights. While these are local average treatment effects, our results suggest that not only do indigenous territories serve a human-rights role, but they are a cost-effective way for governments to preserve their forested areas. First, obtaining full property rights is crucial to recognize indigenous peoples’ original right to land and protect their territories from illegal deforestation.

Under the banner of ‘win–win’ policies, planners actively work to commoditize natural resources and the social relations that determine the use and conservation of these resources. While these general processes seem to hold sway globally, it is crucial not to lose sight of the context specific ways in which neo-liberalism influences conservation practice and local outcomes. The paper examines how neo-liberalism’s global pervasiveness becomes manifest across different levels and scales in South Africa and the Philippines. The conclusion suggests that as a result of these neoliberal pressures, emphasis is shifting from local constructions of ‘nature’by communities to what the environment should mean for communities in terms of commodified resources and growing capitalist markets.",0,0,0,0,0,Geoforum,0,1,Elsevier,2012,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718510000862,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5593106110643335394&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",848,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,170,13.08,85,2,13,https://www.academia.edu/download/48479333/Commodity_Conservation_The_Restructuring20160831-22580-y5z7bg.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:4nD2w1-0nk0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

It has been observed that many forest conservation projects cease as soon as financial support ends hence the need to investigate the phenomenon. This study was undertaken in the South-Eastern part of Kenya within Taita-Taveta County. Cross sectional survey design was used in the study. The study hypothesized that “There was no statistically significant relationship between community empowerment activities and sustainability of forest conservation projects.” It targeted 4138 household heads in five administrative locations considered as clusters in this study. Mixed research methods were used in the collection and analysis of data. A total of 365 quantitative data respondents were selected systematically, while qualitative data respondents were selected purposively. The study ascertained that at least 44.1% of respondents at least agreed that forest projects were sustainable, while 3.9% disagreed. Approximately 52% of respondents neither agreed nor disagreed that forest conservation projects were sustainable. Regression analysis showed F-ratio values of F (4,360)= 66.438; p< 0.05. The null hypothesis was therefore rejected. The study also ascertained that community empowerment influenced the sustainability of forest conservation projects.

McBeath,Comparative environmental politics,comparative environmental politics,"While we cannot hope to provide definitive answers to these questions, as political scientists we proceed from the assumption that much can be learned through the application of the existing tools of comparative political analysis. Two of the incidents occurred in developing countries (one a parliamentary democracy, the other a democratizing presidential system), and one occurred in a highly developed presidential democracy. All three countries are federal systems, with multiple layers of environmental regulation, although sub-national government seems to be better institutionalized and more effective in the United States. Only one of the incidents occurred within the sovereign territory of a country with an effective federal environmental protection agency and highly transparent policy and judicial processes. None of the three nation-states involved has a strong “green” political party. And the affected communities in all three cases remain dissatisfied with the outcomes to varying degrees. What can we make of these observations? Is there a systematic relationship between them (or any other political, social, cultural or economic factors) and the responses to environmental crises by nation-states? To answer these questions a more systematic analysis of the attendant political processes is needed. Only then can we suggest whether hope or despair is a more appropriate reaction. 1. 2 Global Environmental Issues Since the 1960s, environmental issues have entered the agendas of most nation-states.

The stories shape our thinking, but more materially they shape our management of the trees. The meanings we find in these stories influence the choices we make when we plant trees in the city, they alter the ways that we trim and control the trees, and, finally, they inform our decisions to fell them. This chapter explores the history of three persistent narratives about city trees: the narrative of service, the narrative of power, and the narrative of heritage. I argue that these narratives are profoundly humanist in their subordination of the tree to human needs, and I suggest that there is another narrative buried in the archives: the story of the unruly tree. Here I trace the histories of three troublesome species in the city of Ottawa: the Manitoba maple (Acer negundo), the ornamental crab apple (Malus sp.), and the Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra). These are active agential trees that get in the way, cost money and resist human intentions. My point in unearthing their stories is to suggest that, for our own sake, as well as the sake of the trees, we need to move beyond narrowly anthropocentric narratives and consider the unruly tree in the urban landscape.",0,0,0,0,0,"Urban forests, trees, and greenspace",0,1,api.taylorfrancis.com,2014,https://api.taylorfrancis.com/content/chapters/edit/download?identifierName=doi&identifierValue=10.4324/9781315882901-19&type=chapterpdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=2985739544508735395&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",411,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,79,7.18,79,1,11,https://research.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/download/47243.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:o59H7kt6bykJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Largely missing from the story to date, however, is the role of contentious social processes, including contention over land resources. By employing a case study of land conflict over a largeholding in southeastern Pará, Brazil, and a regional-scale statistical model, we describe contentious land change (C-LC) in an area with a long history of antagonism between largeholders and the rural poor. We fuse the conceptual frameworks of political ecology with the methodological approaches of land change science to show that deforestation in the area of study is enhanced due to the interaction of diverse and adversarial agents rather than the independent actions of isolated land managers deforesting according to the dictates of microeconomic optimization. C-LC is a process of global reach and must therefore be added to the topical range of land change science.

225,paper_306,3,D. Kisegu,Contribution of Smallholder Tree Growers to Increasing Tree Cover in Kaliro District,contribution of smallholder tree growers to increasing tree cover in kaliro district,"Many stakeholders including the Ugandan government are growing trees and contributing to increasing tree cover in Uganda. Whereas the contribution of large-scale tree growers to increasing tree cover has been documented, that of smallholder tree growers (STGs) is not known. But because STGs make up the majority of tree growers, it is possible that their contribution to tree cover in the country is significant. In this study we have addressed this gap for Kaliro District. We have also explored the factors that influence tree planting by STGs. Data was collected in the months of January–June 2017 using interviews with 206 tree growers. Included in the survey were all smallholder farms with 20 or more trees. The tree growers planted 39 species, in the period 1997–2016, the most popular of which were Pinus spp., Eucalyptus spp., Grevillea robusta and Maesopsis eminii. Few STGs planted trees in that time (n = 206) and those who did tended to plant few trees (median 175 trees). Despite the average low contribution by STGs, tree cover is increasing due to a few STGs who planted very many trees. Growers who planted the most trees were male or engaged in small-scale business, possessed a university degree and received support from the government. New approaches may be necessary that provide better access to a greater diversity of smallholder farmers such as women and those without low income and education access. STGs affiliated to tree-growing associations appear to have planted fewer trees than those outside tree-growing associations. Tree growers associations should be redesigned to provide maximum benefit to STGs and local ecology. Income generation was cited as the STGs planters’ main motivation for planting trees. However, the key immediate benefit was firewood. These may be important points to consider when developing interventions that target tree planting in the region and throughout Uganda. We conclude that the contribution of STGs to tree growing in Kaliro District is low and that tree planting campaigns should be inclusive and focus on STGs perceived benefits in order to achieve successful reforestation.",0,0,0,0,0,Climate Change Management,0,1,NA,2019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071462723&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071462723&origin=inward,137,Book Chapter,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3_19,1610-2002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071462723,NA,NA,417,433,3,0.5,3,1,6,NA,NA,scopus

For the agri-food sector, multiple instruments have been developed to green supply chains. Yet little is known about the underlying process and conditions under which green sourcing concerns lead to the adoption of specific sustainability instruments among agri-food companies. This study: i) offers a synthesis of the most commonly used instruments agri-food companies adopt to promote sustainability in their supply chains; ii) proposes an analytical framework to elucidate how those decisions are made, based on the competitive environment in which firms operate—with respect to location of their raw materials, technologies available to their suppliers, leverage over upstream suppliers, and end-markets’ characteristics; and iii) presents seven case-studies illustrating the decision-making process leading to the adoption of a specific instrument by a particular company. Companies that do not have sustainable technologies available to improve their environmental practices but operate in highly sensitive places are better off taking their operation somewhere else. But companies with available cleaner technologies, effective law enforcement and control over the supply chains, as well as a brand to protect, can capitalize on their environmental efforts by introducing strict standards, such as third-party certifications. Enforcement of social and environmental regulations at countries of origin is a key factor that deters companies form adopting very strict standards, even if they have a brand value to enhance. The multiplication of private labels and initiatives are, in most cases, not driven by a desire to disorient the consumer, but rather by a careful consideration of the complex conditions under which agri-food supply chains operate. With minor adaptations, the framework could be applied to other economic sectors that have environmental impacts, from mining and energy-generating industries, to apparel, and electronics.",0,0,0,0,0,Journal of cleaner production,0,1,Elsevier,2017,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616318649,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9427605026965059653&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",915,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,284,35.5,95,3,8,https://www.bu.edu/gdp-cn/files/2018/02/RuedaGarrettLambin_2017_JCP_CorporateInvestments.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:RXjwitKU1YIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

As forests are cut down, vital long-term ecological, cultural and economic services are affected, including biodiversity and the climate. For communities in forested areas, the promised benefits often fail to materialise and they are left with loss of access to traditional lands and degraded natural environments. Widespread corruption in the forest sector is often thought to have contributed not only to deforestation, but to the injustices experienced by communities. Based on data collected in Indonesia in 2010-2011, this chapter investigates the mechanisms by which corruption impacts upon the use of forests. Understanding these mechanisms is an important step towards building policies and programmes that can contribute to more sustainable forest management and more just outcomes for communities. The chapter will provide a description of elements of the system of corruption in Indonesia’s forest sector. It will identify the links between corruption and the way decisions are made in the forest sector. The focus is on the system of collusion between government and companies and the mechanisms by which this collusion creates political dependency of decision makers on converting forests and supporting companies, at the expense of the interests of communities. Communities seeking environmental justice face considerable institutional barriers because of corruption.

When these variables are jointly included as explanatory variables in a multiple regression analysis, we find that corruption stands out as a substantial and significant determinant of environmental policies, while proxies for democracy have an insignificant impact. Nevertheless, democracy could affect environmental policy stringency given that countries with a history of democratic rule tend to be less corrupt (see Chap. 3). A discussion of our results in the context of the Environmental Kuznets Curve literature follows. We argue that improving environmental quality following increasing income is less probable in developing countries with institutional disarray.

This omission creates important errors in policy. Resource scarcity induces investments in both commercial and subsistence uses of the forest once prices overcome the costs of establishing property rights, forest management, and the returns from alternative agricultural uses of the land. Therefore deforestation will induce price increases and investments in forestry well before deforestation attains its physical limit. These prices and costs will alter the boundaries among several important classes of forest land: sustainable private forestry, the forested commons, unsustainable open-access forests, and unused residual forest. The greatest impact on the world's forests will come from refocusing the policy dialogue on the cost factors that determine these boundaries, including agricultural support policies, local concentrations of nonmarket environmental resources, and policy failures that distort incentives to invest in forestry.

This study explores the trends and driving forces of deforestation plus traditional practices regarding sustainable forest use and management in the Chencha and Arbaminch areas, Southern Ethiopia. Satellite image analysis (images from 1972, 1984 and 2006) combined with field surveys were used to detect and map changes in forest cover.

The results show a 23 % decline in forest cover between 1972 and 2006 with the most significant change from 1986 to 2006. Change was greatest in the lowlands and remarkable episodic forest changes also occurred, suggesting nonlinear spatial and temporal forest cover dynamics. According to farmers, the main driver of deforestation is agricultural land expansion in response to local population increases and a decline in agricultural production. Growing local and regional fuel wood demand is another chief cause. Despite these issues, remarkable relicts of natural forests remain and trees on farmland, around homesteads and on fields in every village are basic elements of farm activities and social systems. This demonstrates the effect of cumulative traditional knowledge and long-term local experience with forest management and preservation.

Due to apparent large scale land clearing that brought grave consequences to the environment, various initiatives to protect forests from misuse, abuse and overexploitation of forest resources, mainly by plantation companies, were implemented. The attribution of haze caused by burning of forests further pushed for appropriate policies and laws to protect atmospheric quality in Malaysia. Local laws on preventing deforestation and haze are mainly provided in the Environmental Quality Act 1974 and National Forestry Act 1984. Efforts to resolve issues of deforestation and its environmental impacts on air quality should re-emphasize the benefits of practicing Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) to limit environmental impacts of forest activities through continuous participation and commitment from stakeholders, such as the plantation companies. The penalties for deforestation offences in current Malaysian laws whilst it is punitive, should be improved by imposing an environmental tax on polluter companies as a corrective and rehabilitative tool, thus affirming the ‘polluter pays principle’. Environmental tax law could be utilized, for example, in restoring the affected forest area to its natural and original state.

This article addresses Brazil's insistence on sovereignty over its forest resources and questions the capacity of carbon markets to assist in conservation. We start by describing the success of Brazil's efforts to halt deforestation. We then identify player strategies in the ‘Sovereignty versus the market’ debate surrounding the implementation of REDD+. Finally, we discuss whether the markets for land- and forest-based environmental services encouraged by the Forest Code have the potential to contribute to further reductions in deforestation.",0,0,0,0,0,"Forests, Trees and Livelihoods",0,1,Taylor &Francis,2015,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14728028.2015.1017540,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12051233539523750141&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",255,NA,10.1080/14728028.2015.1017540,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17,1.7,17,1,10,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&q=info:_SiW1A2VPqcJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025&scillfp=8223904134776786494&oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:_SiW1A2VPqcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google
245,paper_393,0,C Sharma,Deforestation in Indonesia: The Politics of Land Use Change Post Suharto,deforestation in indonesia: the politics of land use change post suharto,"Over the past 25 years over 130 million hectares of natural forest land on our planet has been lost accelerating climate change and threatening the world’s most diverse ecosystems. Although the annual rate of global deforestation is half of what it was in the early 1990s it remains problematic in several regions of the world. Indonesia, for example, currently accounts for nearly 25% of global deforestation annually and has shown no signs of improvement. This thesis explores some of the key drivers of deforestation in Indonesia by making use of a rich dataset that tracks forest loss across eight years when Indonesia was undergoing political restructuring following the collapse of the Suharto dictatorship. Previous literature has pointed to the expansion in the number of political jurisdictions as a vehicle for increased political corruption which in turn could cause deforestation. The hypothesis is that when a new district is created there is increased competition for the sale of logging permits within a provincial wood market. This may incentivize district governments to issue more than the legal quota of permits consistent with Cournot-style competition. However, the data does not seem to line up with this argument. Instead, forest loss in Indonesia appears to be related to widespread forest fires caused by landowners for the purposes of clearing land primarily for palm oil plantations. The results from this thesis lay the groundwork for future research to focus on the determinants of growing demand for palm oil such as international trade.",0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,prism.ucalgary.ca,2019,https://prism.ucalgary.ca/items/8b504cab-19eb-47fd-b837-ac9ed5fed86a,NA,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,6,https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstreams/a60a1f1d-09e6-4794-bd90-d87d0c2c2048/download,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:cB39zwPaIMUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

248,paper_410,1,AK Saxena,"Deforestation, causes and sustainable solutions with reference to India","deforestation, causes and sustainable solutions with reference to india","This thesis develops a system dynamics simulation model of the deforestation process. It focuses on two measures of deforestation that must be considered simultaneous! y, total forest area (TFA) a geophysical measure and forest biomass (FBM) a biophysical measure. The thesis argues that deforestation is a complex and dynamic process and should therefore be examined with an integrated approach that takes into account the interrelatedness of various elements especially those between the forest sector and other impacting sectors. A system of forests, and four other sectors--agriculture, energy, socio-economic, and livestock--that compete for forest land or forest produce is developed. The process of deforestation is seen in terms of dynamic interaction between all five sectors of the model. Initially, a simple-forest sector only, model is developed to familiarize the reader with the usage of system dynamics concepts. The model is enhanced and expanded to incorporate the remaining four sectors. Three versions of the multi-sector model are developed. Model A is based only on the biophysical flows of interactions, Model B, includes the market responses in addition to the biophysical linkages, and Model C, which in addition to the biophysical and market linkages, also incorporates dynamic functions. Model C is validated by comparing the simulated behaviors of key elements such as forest area, population, livestock number, non-commercial energy consumption, agriculture productivity, and agriculture production, with data for India. Sensitivity analyses examine the impacts of non-forestry policies on deforestation, and explore policies that may sustain forests in India. The simulation results show that if present trends in policies to ameliorate deforestation remain unchanged the depletion of forests in India will continue and within next two decades India will be completely deforested in terms of its biomass. The most important insight obtained from these results is that policies focusing exclusively on the forestry sector will not be sufficient to sustain forests; it is essential to develop supporting policies in the other interacting sectors. Moreover, the results suggest that complete reliance on market forces will not yield sustainability because of the lack of well functioning forestry markets, the operation of non-market incentives, and the slow response times in forestry investments in India. Only a combination of forest sector polices with supporting policies in all other sectors that impact on the forestry sector can prevent deforestation and yield sustainable forestry development.",0,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,utoronto.scholaris.ca,1997,https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/894a0113-bcf0-4f77-afa8-b7708e5beddd,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3830505956608003836&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",800,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0.04,1,1,28,https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/bitstreams/c28d1c0a-0cbb-4365-9f7b-e1c68aa2d379/download,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:_E6jZd-wKDUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Informed by a theoretical model, we employ causal methods to 1) evaluate changes in forest coverage for the first 12 years of policy adoption, and 2) evaluate the effect of the presence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on policy permanence.

This is in contrast to developed countries, where most GHG emissions originate in the industrial and transportation sectors. Forest conversion to agriculture as well as to other uses is among the most important sources of GHG caused by changes in land use, especially in tropical forest-rich countries. Tropical forests retain large volumes of biomass per hectare. As trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is later released as trees die and decompose. This natural cycle maintains a degree of equilibrium in mature forest ecosystems resulting in about zero net emissions. Land clearing, often implying the burning of the forest biomass, interrupts this process, leading to uncompensated emissions of carbon dioxide and other GHG. Existing studies provide estimates of carbon dioxide retention by various species of standing tropical forests, ranging from 100 to 250 metric tons per hectare (Crutzen and Andreae, 1990; World Resources Institute, 1998; Naughton-Treves, 2004). A large portion of stored carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when forests are cleared. Using these measures one can relate deforestation to carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. The objective of this paper is to study the implications of changes in land use induced by economic growth and other policies on deforestation and atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions. We focus on the deforestation mechanism as a source of carbon dioxide emissions. The key questions addressed by this study are: Does a Kuznets curve depicting the relationship between per capita income and forest cover exists? 1 If such a curve exists, at what income level does the turning point occur? How do governance, trade openness and other government policies affect the level and turning point of the forest-income relationship? How does the forest dynamics affect carbon dioxide emission patterns? How are deforestation-induced emissions affected by governance and trade openness?",0,0,0,0,0,EPA report,1,1,researchgate.net,2004,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ramon-Lopez-2/publication/254113631_Deforestation_and_Forest-Induced_Carbon_Dioxide_Emissions_in_Tropical_Countries_How_Do_Governance_and_Trade_Openness_Affect_the_Forest-Income_Relationship/links/0a85e534d9c006d552000000/Deforestation-and-Forest-Induced-Carbon-Dioxide-Emissions-in-Tropical-Countries-How-Do-Governance-and-Trade-Openness-Affect-the-Forest-Income-Relationship.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=14101761532546686419&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",128,PDF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,0.1,1,2,21,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ramon-Lopez-2/publication/254113631_Deforestation_and_Forest-Induced_Carbon_Dioxide_Emissions_in_Tropical_Countries_How_Do_Governance_and_Trade_Openness_Affect_the_Forest-Income_Relationship/links/0a85e534d9c006d552000000/Deforestation-and-Forest-Induced-Carbon-Dioxide-Emissions-in-Tropical-Countries-How-Do-Governance-and-Trade-Openness-Affect-the-Forest-Income-Relationship.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:0522RmaFs8MJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

A theory of deliberate policy disproportionality is used to analyse 20 years of regulatory reform in Queensland, focusing on the Vegetation Management Act (VMA) 1999. Application of the framework to this case suggests that political executives were prone to deliberately adopt (dis)proportionate policies as a strategic response to either manage or capitalise on stakeholder support or opposition to any proposed legislative change. The high variance in (dis)proportionate deforestation policies is attributed to how political executives respond to claims made by competing constituencies regarding the costs versus benefits of successive reforms. During key reform phases, policy under-reaction was the norm, and political executives intentionally limited the scope and effectiveness of the VMA 1999 due to perceived impacts on the agricultural sector. Political executives were highly responsive to the emotional investment of rural constituents and averse to introducing policies that required difficult trade-offs. Elections offered strategic opportunities for delivering more proportionate policies that balanced public environmental benefits with economic impacts, as evidenced by a conditional deforestation ban introduced between 2004 and 2012 and reinstated in 2018. Points for practitionersVariance in Queensland's deforestation policy over time can be attributed to the intentional decisions by political executives to limit or expand the scope of regulations as a strategic response to stakeholder expectations.Political executives were responsive to the costs versus environmental impacts/benefits of any deforestation reforms, but prone to policy under-reaction when the priority was managing the emotive reactions from rural constituencies.More proportionate regulations, such as the partial deforestation ban of 2004, aimed to balance environmental benefits with compensation for landholders but were only implemented when electorally beneficial.Stakeholders have a significant influence on disproportionate deforestation policy design and governments will need to manage competing claims to deliver more durable policy outcomes.",0,0,0,0,0,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0,1,WILEY,2024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8500.12593,NA,NA,Article,10.1111/1467-8500.12593,0313-6647,NA,83,1,50,68,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience

We use economic growth, population growth, urbanization, and energy use variables along with rarely used measures of political and economic freedom to see how they influence carbon emissions and the scope of any potential EKC. We compare a sampling of 22 OECD countries with a selection of 87 non-OECD countries, with the non-OECD countries divided up into the subcategories of free, not free, partially free, and transition. We use an upgraded dataset from the World Bank Development Indicators and the improved econometric technique Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator to better evaluate the interactions between these variables and CO2 emissions. We find no evidence of a CO2 EKC for the OECD and non-OECD regions, and mixed results for the impact of political and economic freedom, depending on region. CO2 emissions instead tend to increase monotonically with a rising income, suggesting governments and industry need to do more to curb those emissions as development grows.",0,0,0,0,0,Energy Research &Social Science,1,1,Elsevier,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629617303481,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17016753807308586760&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",798,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,138,19.71,69,2,7,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:CH_n2m2nJ-wJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

We find that the original results of Buitenzorgy and Mol (2011) were spurious and inconsistent in the replication once heteroskedasticity robust standard errors were employed. When combining the two time periods and running analyses on panel data and differenced data for robust outcomes and better policy inferences, we find different results for the effect of democracy on deforestation, indicating that model specification is critical to studying this relationship. The more econometrically sound method, the differenced models, reject the Environmental Kuznet's Curve (EKC) hypothesis for democracy and deforestation, instead indicating that democracy decreased deforestation rates. When adding democracy spillover effects to the model, i.e., the impact on deforestation rates due to changes in democracy levels in neighboring countries, we still find that democracy leads to decreased rates of deforestation.

We focus on the effect of political regime type on human activities that directly damage the environment. Our discussion of the theoretical literature identifies different causal mechanisms through which democracy could affect environmental degradation. The empirical analysis focuses on the net effect of these competing mechanisms. We examine statistically the effect of democracy on five aspects of human-induced environmental degradation-carbon dioxide emissions, nitrogen dioxide emissions, deforestation, land degradation, and organic pollution in water. We find that democracy reduces all five types of environmental degradation.

Democracy in Practice brings together, for the first time, the collected experience of 30 years of public involvement in environmental decisionmaking. Using data from 239 cases, the authors evaluate the success of public participation and the contextual and procedural factors that lead to it. Thomas Beierle and Jerry Cayford demonstrate that public participation has not only improved environmental policy, but it has also played an important educational role and has helped resolve the conflict and mistrust that often plague environmental issues. Among the authors' findings are that intensive 'problem-solving' processes are most effective for achieving a broad set of social goals, and participant motivation and agency responsiveness are key factors for success. Democracy in Practice will be useful for a broad range of interests. For researchers, it assembles the most comprehensive data set on the practice of public participation, and presents a systematic typology and evaluation framework. For policymakers, political leaders, and citizens, it provides concrete advice about what to expect from public participation, and how it can be made more effective.

New York: Oxford University Press â€¦","democracy in the woods: environmental conservation and social justice in india, tanzania, and mexico. by prakash kashwan. new york: oxford university press â€¦","Democracy in the Woods addresses these question by examining land rights conflicts--and the fate of forest-dependent peasants--in the context of the different forest property regimes in India, Tanzania, and Mexico. These three countries are prominent in the scholarship and policy debates about national forest policies and land conflicts associated with international support for nature conservation. This unique comparative study of national forestland regimes challenges the received wisdom that redistributive policies necessarily undermine the goals of environmental protection. It shows instead that the form that national environmental protection efforts take--either inclusive (as in Mexico) or exclusive (as in Tanzania and, for the most part, in India)--depends on whether dominant political parties are compelled to create structures of political intermediation that channel peasant demands for forest and land rights into the policy process. This book offers three different tests of this theory of political origins of forestland regimes. First, it explains why it took the Indian political elites nearly sixty years to introduce meaningful reforms of the colonial-era forestland regimes. Second, it successfully explains the rather counterintuitive local outcomes of the programs for formalization of land rights in India, Tanzania, and Mexico. Third, it provides a coherent explanation of why each of these three countries proposes a significantly different distribution of the benefits of forest-based climate change mitigation programs being developed under the auspices of the United Nations.

In its political analysis of the control over and the use of nature, this book opens up new avenues for reflecting on how legacies of the past and international interventions interject into domestic political processes to produce specific configurations of environmental protection and social justice.

Some of those issues, such as the consolidation of democracy, poverty, and human rights, had been the subject of considerable study by scholars. Much less studied, however, although also on the agenda, was the promise to address Chile’s environmental problems, which had become much exacerbated under the laissez-faire economic model favored by the military regime. Because the new democratic administrations have followed through on that promise, the Chilean example lends support to that hypothesis which holds that environmental concerns in developing countries can be addressed more effectively under economically stable democratic regimes than by authoritarian political systems.

Recent comparative analyses of democratisation drawing on modernisation theories refer to a wide range of more or less propitious economic, political, social and cultural conditions; but environmental variables are not amongst them, nor is there consideration of the possible consequences of democratisation for the environment (for example, Dahl 1989, Diamond et al. 1989, Vanhanen 1990, Hedenius 1992, Lipset 1994, Fukuyama 1995). Such analyses framed by transition theories, in which democratisation is seen as driven by the agency of particular elite initiatives, alliances and conflicts, likewise have nothing to say on this subject (for instance, Di Palma 1990, Mainwaring et al. 1992, Higley and Gunther 1992, Schmitter 1994, Pridham 1995). The same is the case with respect to explanations using some form of structural theory, in which democratisation is regarded as one of several historical trajectories each shaped by changing structures of class, state and transnational power (for example, Haggard and Kaufman 1992, Rueschemeyer et al. 1992, Potter 1993, Stephens 1993). In other recent works on democracy and democratisation there is no mention of the environment or only the briefest of references ‘in passing’ (examples are Beetham 1994, Held 1993, Parry and Moran 1994). Huntington's (1994) major review article of the comparative politics literature on democratisation pays attention to both causes and consequences of democratisation, but there is no mention of possible environmental consequences.",0,1,0,0,0,NGOs and Environmental Policies,1,1,taylorfrancis.com,2005,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203989135-2/democratisation-environment-ngos-deforestation-policies-india-karnataka-indonesia-north-sumatra-david-potter,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1048364388828196903&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",26,NA,10.4324/9780203989135-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32,1.6,32,1,20,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:JzBGb9uJjA4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Working Paper","democratization, elections, and public goods: the evidence from deforestation. working paper","This article shows that over the last three decades, competitive elections were associated with increased deforestation. Protection of forested areas provides long?term public goods, while their destruction provides short?term private goods for particular voters. Politicians facing a competitive election offer voters access to forested areas mainly for small?scale farming or commercial use of timber in exchange for electoral support. I test this theory of political deforestation using satellite generated global forest cover data and the results of over 1,000 national?level elections between 1982 and 2016. I find that countries that undergo a democratic transition lose an additional 0.8 percentage points of their forest cover each year, that years with close elections have over 1 percentage point per year higher forest cover loss compared to nonelection years, and that as the margin of victory in an election decreases by 10 points, the amount of deforestation increases by 0.7 percentage points per year. These increases are on the order of 5–10 times the average rate of forest loss globally.

Some scientists find that democracy has a positive impact in reducing environmental disruption. Other scholars claim that democracy tends to accelerate environmental degradation. By using deforestation rates as a proxy for environmental disruption, we suggest that both sides might be right. Our quantitative analysis has three important outcomes. First, there is evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between deforestation and democracy. Second, countries in democratic transition experience the highest deforestation rates, compared to non-democracies and mature democracies. Third, in explaining deforestation rates democracy has larger explanatory power than income.

A Cross-National Analysis,does freedom of domestic movement impact forest loss? a cross-national analysis,"On the one hand, previous research argues that growth in rural populations leads to forest loss from clearing trees to make room for the growing population and their farming needs. On the other hand, research is also concerned with how deforestation drives people out of rural areas, leading to overurbanization. From this work, it is clear that the movement of people has an important relationship to forest loss, but it is less clear what the autonomy of people is in this process. Put differently, more focus has been put on state-level economic and environmental factors than political factors when considering the impact of domestic migration on forest loss. Although there has been substantial work on how political factors, like democracy, impact forest loss, there is less research on how political rights, like freedom of domestic movement, may impact forest loss. To build on this research, we test the impact of freedom of domestic movement and democracy on forest loss from 2001 to 2014 for a sample of 107 low- and middle-income nations. We find support for the idea that having more freedom of movement decreases forest loss in more democratic nations compared to less democratic nations. We also find that both rural and urban population growth, among others, is associated with higher levels of forest loss.

The identified major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in the province include increasing population, migration from lowland to upland areas, illegal logging, mining, wide-scale kaingin and oil palm plantation, wildlife poaching, and weak policy implementation and enforcement.

Deforestation predictions using those widely applied drivers can underestimate deforestation rates by as much as 50%. We show that years with the highest deforestation rates also correlate with large administrative shifts caused by presidential elections which results in periods of managerial instability associated with episodic inefficiency, leading to weak institutions unable to properly combat illegal deforestation. Although surveillance and regulatory action plans to combat deforestation have held back deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2005, our results suggest that environmental management institutions should be aware such administration shifts set a burden on the policy targets associated with conservation policies.

Specifically, the paper focuses on the effect of energy justice and democratization. The main contribution to the literature hinges on the emphasis on energy justice - operationalized as rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking - and its interaction with democracy. Using a panel data of 47 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2000-2020 and the dynamic two-step generalized method of moment estimator, the results generally indicate that improvement in rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking is associated with a reduction in deforestation. Democracy is similarly found to be associated with reduction in deforestation. The conditional effect analysis largely depicts an intensified reducing effect of energy justice on deforestation in the presence of improved democratic practices.

Through a survey of a wide range of studies conducted in different parts of India it points to the constraints, both of institutional design as well as of social inequalities of gender and caste, that inhibit a fuller and more effective participation by women.

This empirical research examines two interrelated questions: how do Indigenous Peoples perceive centralized mining affecting their traditional forest rights, and what are some of the community-led initiatives to address mining governance and forest policy? Two aspects of the rights-based approach on the extreme continuum – Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and social movements – are used for analyzing three ethnographic case studies each from India’s top three mining states, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha. The forested landscapes are inhabited by a million ethnically diverse Indigenous Peoples also known as Scheduled Tribes or Adivasis, often devoid of formal recognition. The Oraon, Pando, Paudi Bhuniya, and Munda Indigenous communities face the consequences of mining-induced deforestation on their livelihoods and are excluded from land-use decisions before and after extractions. The findings compare diverse forms of social movements seeking decentralized mining and community-based forest governance. Key recommendations from the Indigenous communities for inclusive forest and land-use policy are illuminated in the conclusion.

These methods generally require large samples for statistical comparisons, presenting a challenge for evaluating innovative policies implemented within a few pioneering jurisdictions. Single jurisdictions often are studied using comparative methods, which rely on analysts’ selection of best case comparisons. The synthetic control method (SCM) offers one systematic and transparent way to select cases for comparison, from a sizeable pool, by focusing upon similarity in outcomes before the intervention. We explain SCM, then apply it to one local initiative to limit deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The municipality of Paragominas launched a multi-pronged local initiative in 2008 to maintain low deforestation while restoring economic production. This was a response to having been placed, due to high deforestation, on a federal “blacklist” that increased enforcement of forest regulations and restricted access to credit and output markets. The local initiative included mapping and monitoring of rural land plus promotion of economic alternatives compatible with low deforestation. The key motivation for the program may have been to reduce the costs of blacklisting. However its stated purpose was to limit deforestation, and thus we apply SCM to estimate what deforestation would have been in a (counterfactual) scenario of no local initiative. We obtain a plausible estimate, in that deforestation patterns before the intervention were similar in Paragominas and the synthetic control, which suggests that after several years, the initiative did lower deforestation (significantly below the synthetic control in 2012). This demonstrates that SCM can yield helpful land-use counterfactuals for single units, with opportunities to integrate local and expert knowledge and to test innovations and permutations on policies that are implemented in just a few locations.",0,0,0,0,0,PloS one,0,1,journals.plos.org,2015,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132590,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=373218117080490670&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",246,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,140,14,28,5,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132590,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:rqJSbObvLQUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google
284,paper_612,8,"Hagene, T","Everyday political practices, democracy and the environment in a native village in Mexico City","everyday political practices, democracy and the environment in a native village in mexico city","In recent years there has been a debate about the extent to which democratization implies protection of the environment. This article offers an exemplary case of this debate, exploring the theoretical links between democracy and environmental protection advanced by Walker (1999): accountability, development and participation. The site of the study is a Mexican native village, one of many incorporated into the metropolis, Mexico City. The city is faced with the challenge to supply an expanding population of some 20 million with housing, clean water and oxygen. The forest in the common property belonging to the original inhabitants is formally protected with logging bans and a rigorous Land Use Plan, yet illegal sales of this communal land to new settlers result in irregular settlements which now contain one quarter of the village's inhabitants. In 1997 local elections were reinstated in Mexico City, after a suspension of nearly 70 years. Although the governing party in the city promoted the protective Land Use Plan, the party's local politicians promised to regularize the zone in exchange for votes from the irregular settlers. These dynamics are explored in the context of everyday political practices in the village. The struggles over material and symbolic resources are analyzed in terms of force fields with multiple actors, making visible the ways in which democratic elections alone cannot prevent the ongoing deforestation caused by irregular settlements.

Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.",1,0,0,0,0,PLoS One,0,1,journals.plos.org,2018,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197391,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=12647021197134008040&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",378,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,101,14.43,20,5,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197391,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:6A4CosU-g68J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

For example, elected local government authorities, who ostensibly represent rural people, are neither present in the UN-REDD board nor were they invited to the participatory forums that vetted the Nigeria-REDD.

A critical review of the main environmental problems with prioritization within the forestry sector; thorough review of all forest related documents, strategies, development plans, programs, institutional arrangements, policies mentioned in the Master Plan for Forestry Sector Nepal of 1988, and other relevant documents; identification of major gaps and constraints of forestry policy and plans and current practices of forest conservation and management have been done. The decline in forestry resources in Nepal took place in the past due to lack of appropriate policy to guide the legal, institutional and operational development for the forestry sector. Forestry policy in Nepal, in the past, was shaped by political and economic motives rather than ecological considerations. Policy formulation mechanisms exist in Nepal; however, there is an excessive delay in translating policies into legislation and then into operational rules and administrative orders. There is a need to implement the international obligations by transforming them into regulations in order to make them legally binding. The data to be generated in the coming years in the areas of forestry at both national and international levels suggest that we should revise the research priorities and strategies. Research to add value to the forest resource products has yet been neglected. More attention is required on regular monitoring and evaluation of the projects.

Based on the in-depth-analysis of 16 forest protection protests in Germany and by analysing 49 newspaper articles, I can show that forest conservation from below is characterized by the strategic framing of climate and ecological emergencies by movement actors, the willingness of movement actors to build alliances with a broad range of societal actors, prefigurative politics aiming at circumvening institutionalized public policy making, criticisms of the state-industry nexus, global justice theories aiming at reducing inequalities and a politico-theoretical approach, which contains the assumption that forests should be de-commodified.",0,0,0,0,0,Forest Squats and Eco-Solidarism in Germany,1,1,papers.ssrn.com,2022,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4029269,NA,683,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,1,3,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm?abstractid=4029269,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:dRLNIUFcB_8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Olmo,"Forest plantations with public subsidies: to harvest or not to harvest, this is the question","forest plantations with public subsidies: to harvest or not to harvest, this is the question","In the last three decades the European Union has supported the afforestation of lands previously devoted to agriculture through targeted subsidies, thus enhancing the provision of many ecosystem services (ESs). However, most of these plantations are close or even above the minimum permanence period and will be likely eradicated by landowners to restore the previous land use (ie, croplands). In this scenario, the investments for carbon (C) sequestration will be nullified and the supply of many other ESs, which have developed along with plants growth, will be drastically reduced. In this commentary, using as reference a case study in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Autonomous Region (NE Italy), we quantify the value of wood production and C sequestration ESs of tree plantations, simulating a present and a future scenario. Our simulations show that by extending the permanence of these stands for 20 more years, a 34% increase of biomass annual Net Present Value will be expected on average, according to its final use. Regarding C sequestration, a total C stock of 167 tC ha-1 can be estimated in 40 years, corresponding to a cumulative Net Present Value of more than 11 million euro. Thus, if C sequestration is considered, the overall annual Net Present Value shows a 35% increase on average, when compared to a reconversion to corn. These data suggest the need for a new national and European strategy, which not only considers well-planned new afforestation campaigns, but also aims at maintaining at least part of the afforested lands, thus maximizing ESs and supporting high quality wood production. At the end of the rotation period, new cycles can be promoted on the same surfaces through natural gamic or agamic regeneration. An additional important aspect to consider is also related to the active management of these stands, thus to improve their growth (quantity and quality), in situ C storage as well as storage in final products.",1,0,0,0,0,IForest,0,1,NA,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85136826237&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85136826237&origin=inward,111,Article,10.3832/ifor3943-015,1971-7458,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85136826237,15,4,229,233,1,0.33,1,1,3,NA,NA,scopus

Based on a vast amount of research and detailed case-studies in Brazil, Central America, Nepal and Tanzania, as well as other work dealing with wider themes and regions, the book argues that most current discussions of increased rates of deforestation and perceived accompanying environmental crises are overly simplistic. Institutional reforms and policy measures that have been undertaken in developing countries usually failed to protect either the forests or people's livelihoods. Technical solutions to deforestation are only one element in what are essentially political questions. The central issue is not how to halt deforestation but rather how to manage forest areas and natural resources in order to meet social goals on a more equitable and sustainable basis.

However, the local Baining people have been able to resist the bribes of the Asian loggers. These loggers have been persistent, returning every now and then with more promises.

Activists protested the road-building and transmigration projects that were catalyzing deforestation in Brazil and Indonesia; bilateral and multilateral donors mobilized funds for investment in forest protection; conservation organizations established alliances with indigenous and traditional peoples; and governments launched negotiations toward an international agreement on forests. Interest in tropical forests peaked in the aftermath of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio in 1992, and steadily declined over the next decade as national and international efforts to reverse deforestation proved disappointing.
Tropical deforestation has now reappeared on the international agenda due to its newly-appreciated link to climate change. In 2006, a review commissioned by the Government of the United Kingdom (Stern 2006) called attention to the fact that some 20 percent of current annual global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) is due to land use change–most of which is deforestation in developing countries–a share greater than the emissions produced by the transport sector globally. The review asserted that controlling deforestation could provide one of the least expensive strategies for reducing emissions, and that such efforts must be a key element of any future climate protection regime. As a result, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) is now central to discussions of global and national mitigation strategies.",0,0,0,0,0,"CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia",0,1,Citeseer,2008,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=b4d72969e05ae973fe82d6f9d22fb659215baca5,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=2590617779039985721&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",870,PDF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,96,5.65,96,1,17,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=b4d72969e05ae973fe82d6f9d22fb659215baca5,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:OWB99CS58yMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

This paper reviews elements of justice in the values, knowledge, access and property rights relating to forests, especially in developing countries. Rather than defining justice in general terms of distribution of benefits and recognition of stakeholders, we argue that these processes are mutually defining, and can foreclose what is distributed, and to whom. Much recent forest policy, for example, emphasises forest carbon stocks and the benefits to indigenous peoples; but these terms de?emphasise livelihood outcomes for forests, and non?indigenous smallholders. Accordingly, we argue that current operationalisations of justice in forest policy based on John Rawls' principles of fair allocation to known actors need to be replaced by Amartya Sen's more deliberative and inclusive vision of justice that focuses instead on how different users experience different benefits, and seek to achieve multiple objectives together.",0,0,0,0,0,The Geographical Journal,0,1,Wiley Online Library,2013,https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geoj.12006,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15473568666239433945&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",892,NA,10.1111/geoj.12006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,93,7.75,47,2,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim-Forsyth-2/publication/264323701_Forests_Development_and_the_Globalization_of_Justice/links/62e3b8843c0ea87887659232/Forests-Development-and-the-Globalization-of-Justice.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:2fzQLrgovdYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

However, an emerging slavery-environment nexus is demonstrating the urgent necessity of engaging with slavery and deforestation holistically, to aid effective action. Accordingly, the research aimed to investigate the slavery-environment nexus in the Brazilian Amazon, by engaging with three core components: vulnerability to enslavement, slavery-deforestation links, and assessing labour and environmental inspections. Mixed qualitative methods revealed that proximate determinants of vulnerability (poverty, lack of access to land, lack of education and social isolation) are multifaceted and produced by underlying determinants (unequal land distribution, racial discrimination, economic globalisation and policies undermining distribution). Furthermore, slavery and deforestation were found to be organised by criminal networks in geographically isolated spaces, specifically among interconnected sectors at the bottom of the supply chain. These characteristics facilitate slavery and deforestation by lessening the risk of detection and punishment, which was compounded by the Bolsonaro government demobilising labour and environmental inspections. Alleviating vulnerability through redistributing land prevailed as a practical recommendation, however there is also need for research to engage further with the underlying determinants of vulnerability and slavery-deforestation links.

Reid,"Globalization, democracy and the aesthetic ecology of emergent publics for a sustainable world: Working from John Dewey","globalization, democracy and the aesthetic ecology of emergent publics for a sustainable world: working from john dewey","The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA.A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationalism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic struggle for a republican alternative to imperialism. By and large, neo-liberal policies ""from above"" have aggravated various types of inequality and the militaristic turn pursued by some elites compounds not only negative side effects but critical opportunities. Democratic action in and from the United States has to be clear about both place-based forms of life and expanding forms of solidarity in global struggles for democracy and the commons.Our reading of Dewey is strengthened by research that highlights his ecological ontology and its key role in his democratic theory. We argue that globalizing knowledge regimes and their products, such as deforestation, re-institute destructive dualisms that would be transformed by a Deweyan approach that energizes democratic forms of agency and policy. Dewey's essay on ""Time and Individuality"" is explicated to disclose the radical democratic implications of Deweyan science. We show further that this approach, as a field science and ecological stewardship, provides public alternatives to violence, whether primarily ""social"" or ""environmental"". A Deweyan logic of particularity casts in contrasting relief our historical epoch's dominant logic of fungibility, the fetishization of global economic space, and its looming costs. The reclamation and reconstruction of democratic publics are long overdue and requires new regimes of participatory and place-based knowledge opening on the global commons for sustainable life.",0,0,0,0,0,Asian Journal of Social Science,0,1,NA,2006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33645814608&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33645814608&origin=inward,62,Article,10.1163/156853106776150135,1568-4849,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/33645814608,34,1,22,46,7,0.37,7,1,19,NA,NA,scopus

There is a multitude of empirical studies examining this relationship using various measures of governance and study designs, coming to diverse conclusions. In order to identify the source of variation across studies, this article conducts a meta-analysis of 32 empirical cross-country studies in the field of economics, containing 227 estimates of the impact of different governance measures on deforestation. Using an ordered probit model, we find that the choice of the governance measure is the main factor in explaining variations in the outcomes of the studies. In particular, studies using environmental policy, ownership rights, presence of environmental NGOs, and rule of law as measures of governance, are more likely to find that better governance reduces deforestation. In contrast, studies using democracy and rights as a measure of governance are more likely to find that deforestation increases, when governance is improved.

Environmental considerations must be at the heart of economic growth, especially for a country of 1.25 billion people destined to add another 400 million by the middle of the century. Green Signals chronicles the '1991 moment' in India's environmental decision-making, telling the story of how, for the first time, the doors of the environment ministry were opened to voices, hitherto unheard, into the policy-making process. It details efforts to change the way environment is viewed both by proponents of environmental security and those who prize economic growth at all costs. Told from the perspective of a pivotal decision maker, the book addresses the challenges involved in trying to ensure economic growth with ecological security. It takes us through India's coming of age in the global environmental and climate change community to take on a leadership role that is progressive, proactive, and steeped in national interest. Using speaking orders on high-profile projects, notes and letters to the Prime Minister, ministerial colleagues, chief ministers and others, Jairam Ramesh gives an insight into the debates, struggles, challenges, and obstacles to bringing environmental considerations into the mainstream of political and economic decision-making.

306,paper_751,124,V Plumwood,Has democracy failed ecology? An ecofeminist perspective,has democracy failed ecology? an ecofeminist perspective,"The superiority of democracy over other political systems in detecting and responding to ecological problems lies in its capacity for correctiveness. That this correctiveness is not operating well in liberal democracy is a further reason for questioning its identification with democracy. The radical inequality that increasingly thrives in liberal democracy is an indicator not only of the capacity of its privileged groups to distribute social goods upwards and to create rigidities which hinder the democratic correctiveness of social institutions, but is also an indicator of their ability to redistribute many ecological ills downwards and to create similar rigidities in dealing with ecological ills. It is therefore not democracy that has failed ecology, but liberal democracy that has failed both democracy and ecology. Ecological denial is structured into liberalism in multiple ways, particularly through its reason/nature dualism, its limitation of democracy, its disposition of public and private spaces, and its marginalisation of collective forms of life. A radical democratic alternative would reshape the public/private distinction to open the way for a public as well as a private ethics of environmental responsibility, for the diffusion of practices of responsibility and care through crucial areas from which liberalism strips them, and for the development of a democratic culture which displaces reason/nature dualism.",0,1,0,0,0,Environmental Politics,1,1,Taylor &Francis,1995,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644019508414231,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10374256818165908263&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",920,NA,10.1080/09644019508414231,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,124,4.13,124,1,30,https://scholar.archive.org/work/4fr6tyryy5ebrdhlif7vwler3a/access/wayback/http://jan.ucc.nau.edu:80/~dss4/Plumwood3.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:JwN0Z5zD-I8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Adopting the concept of co-production from Science and Technology Studies (STS), this paper argues that well-known approaches to environmentality fail to acknowledge how both state and citizens can both actively participate in reifying authoritative expertise about environmental problems; and that this expertise can be based on shared visions of social order, which also exclude alternative perspectives about environmental management. The paper illustrates this debate with the history of legislation and social movements about community forestry in Thailand, where different state agencies and non-governmental organisations have disagreed about policies, but also demonstrated hidden alliances that reify and legitimise statements about the hydraulic functions of forests that exclude long-standing scientific research or alternative options for watershed management. The paper argues that political debates about community forestry should therefore pay more attention to how political opponents agree-and the social groups and policy options that are excluded from these agreements-rather than only analyse how one party might have power over another.",0,0,0,0,0,Conservation and Society,1,1,journals.lww.com,2014,https://journals.lww.com/coas/fulltext/2014/12040/Hidden_Alliances__Rethinking_Environmentality_and.7.aspx,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13729664947441059382&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",222,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,52,4.73,26,2,11,https://journals.lww.com/coas/fulltext/2014/12040/Hidden_Alliances__Rethinking_Environmentality_and.7.aspx,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:NkZb3YaRib4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Through time, exploitation of natural resources increased to cope with the requirements of more and more complex civilizations. In this work, a review of how the Spanish forests were influenced by human activities and their changes is provided. Forests were cleared for mining, charcoal, shipbuilding and caulking. The most fertile lands were converted into cultivation and more productive cultivars were introduced. Mobile livestock, in particular sheep, became widespread, and with it the burning of wooded land to produce pastures. Woods were privatized through a series of disentailments. All these factors have occurred during the history of Spain, linked to profound changes in the landscape and vegetation.

The new political conjuncture is comprised on three inter-related elements: a Constitutional Court decision to recognise Indigenous land claims; the development of the Reducing Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation Plus (REDD+) forest carbon programme; and a national initiative known as One-map. Drawing on concepts of governmentality, assemblage and territoriality we trace how the Indigenous People’s Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN) are using this moment to assemble a land claim in Bahanei. We find that the conjuncture is providing opportunities for Indigenous communities to engage with a new assemblage of interests normally associated with green grabs to claim land back from state and private interests. However, the romantic green Indigenous subjectivities the new political conjuncture requires to attract carbon investment rarely fit the heterogeneous make up of village life.

We use comprehensive datasets from the MapBiomas database for our deforestation calculations. This relatively new database affords us the opportunity to analyze changes in Brazilian municipalities from a single data source over an extended period rather than having to draw from separate sources with different methodologies. We use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of increases in transfers on deforestation in Brazil, emphasizing on municipalities in the Legal Amazon. Results obtained from the entire sample show that larger transfers result in significant increases in gross deforestation. Extending our analysis to pooled thresholds and pooled years, we find some evidence of separate patterns between the period from 1997–2006 and the period from 2008–2016, but mixed effects in both magnitude and statistical significance when we restrict our samples to individual thresholds. While there is evidence in the first period that is in line with our expectation of larger transfers leading to higher levels of deforestation, the surprising positive increases in forest coverage in the second period 2008–2016 suggest the promising possibility of governmental transfers having beneficial impacts on efforts to reduce deforestation in Brazil as well.",1,0,0,0,0,NA,0,1,openaccess.nhh.no,2019,https://openaccess.nhh.no/nhh-xmlui/handle/11250/2609470,NA,174,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,0,2,6,https://openaccess.nhh.no/nhh-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2609470/masterthesis.PDF?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:s01NXWlYaf0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The underlying hypothesis is that in addition to income, as reflected from the literature on the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, several other factors, including socioeconomic (e.g. human development and corruption) and sociopolitical (e.g. ability to exercise democratic rights) factors, may influence environmental policy?making, and thereby environmental sustainability, in a country. The EQ (i.e. environmental sustainability) of the countries in the current study is denoted by their Environmental Performance Index (2008). Human development is represented by Human Development Index (2007).

The case of tropical deforestation,is the power of brand-focused activism rising? the case of tropical deforestation,"Four trends would seem to be empowering environmentalists who target corporations with global brands: the increasing reach of social media, growing numbers of campaigns, the corporate turn toward “sustainability” to create brand value and manage supply chains, and the spread of eco-consumerism. Campaigns since 2007 to demand that brands stop buying palm oil linked to tropical deforestation confirm the rising influence over corporate policies and market demand. Many activists are portraying the outcomes as “victories” toward saving rainforests. Yet, three factors are limiting the value for improving on-the-ground management: industry influence over, and governance limits of, palm oil certification; ongoing sales of uncertified palm oil as demand shifts to nonbrand buyers; and illegalities and weak regulatory enforcement in producer countries, notably Indonesia and Malaysia.

321,paper_915,1,N Barmeyer,Local Effects of Global Forest Conservation Policy: On Zapotec Resistance against a Protected Natural Area,local effects of global forest conservation policy: on zapotec resistance against a protected natural area,"Forest conservation is a controversial issue for the indigenous Zapotec of the Southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, with whom I have been working for the past three years. Officials from the Mexican Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and contracted surveyors have visited their villages, seeking to set up “Protected Natural Areas”(Áreas Naturales Protegidas). This initiative includes a variety of schemes, ranging from ecological surveys to payment for ecosystem services. However, there is a growing sentiment among the people living in the affected region that the main beneficiaries of such schemes are outsiders: the surveyors and evaluators who are being paid for their studies; the state, which is receiving money via the carbon market for each hectare declared a conservation area; big businesses seeking to make natural resources accessible to the market; and, last but not least, local go-betweens and corrupt officials skimming off the funds intended for the communities. To the people on the ground, the motives for the sudden interest in their territories are often unclear; furthermore, prospecting activities evoke memories of past interventions by the state or by private enterprises, such as mining or logging companies, which deprived the people of their resources and often also repressed them.
Protected Natural Areas have been heavily promoted since the United Nations adopted the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation in 2002, which called for signatory countries to designate at least ten percent of their territory as such (CBD 2002, 7). Among conservation organizations and policy makers, these areas are widely regarded as instruments for counteracting the effects of climate change and CO2 emissions. In 2000, with global environmental policy allocating ever more importance and money to biodiversity and carbon sinks, Mexico adjusted its legal and institutional framework to increase its conservation zones. Ten years later, the National Commission for Protected Natural Areas (CONANP) managed some 25 million hectares, about 13 percent of Mexican territory (Schmidt 2010, 19).",0,0,0,0,0,RCC Perspectives,0,1,JSTOR,2012,https://www.jstor.org/stable/26234337,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4638621301670810879&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",640,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0.08,1,1,13,https://www.environmentandsociety.org/sites/default/files/seiten_aus_rcc_layout_issue5_2012-5_0.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:_xSmVX-xX0AJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Its causes are highly complex, spanning local social and community dynamics to national political hierarchies and global corporate politics, current and historic. Development plays a key role, with global neo-liberal imperatives leveraged, resisted and competing with myriad multi-level agendas and actors. Gramscian analysis of logics and ideology, which combine to construct a global and local “common sense,” helps to explain the mixed messages of policy and conservation, which themselves make Indonesian deforestation and its solutions so complicated. Solutions to forest destruction, presented in the form of payment for ecosystem services, multi-stakeholder initiatives, improved governance and transparency within a neo-liberal market framework, have had limited success. The reason for this limited success lies in the notion, encouraged by multilateral and development thinking, that commodification of communities and nature will also conserve forests. Drawing on fieldwork in Indonesia and the United States, this article argues that discrepancies in development and economic policy, which lead to ecologically destructive outcomes like tropical deforestation, cannot be patched up by innovative market tools.

We determine whether a paradigmatic change in forest-related policy occurred and the mechanism by which change has or has not taken place through the interpretation of policy citation networks and statistical analysis of temporal relationships between forest related policy content and change over time. We find that there was a significant increase in the amount of Indonesian forest-related policy from 1999 to 2016 and that it was largely comprised of content that promotes forest protection and redefines the structure and funding for forest-related organizations. These content changes primarily occurred through the process of policy layering, when new policy does not amend or repeal old policy and regulation. We discuss current trends in the regulation of forest territory and flow in Indonesia and find further evidence of policy layering.

331,paper_1034,109,R. Carmenta,Perceptions across scales of governance and the Indonesian peatland fires,perceptions across scales of governance and the indonesian peatland fires,"Across leading environmental challenges—fire management, climate change, deforestation – there is growing awareness of the need to better account for diverse stakeholder perceptions across complex, multi-level governance arrangements. Perceptions often condition behavior, compliance and engagement in ways that impact environmental outcomes. We illustrate the importance of, and approaches to, examining perceptions across scales of governance (e.g. international, national, local) and sectors (e.g. civil society, government, corporate) through the example of Indonesian peatland fires. Peatlands are crucial global carbon stocks threatened by land use change and fire and subject to a range of policy interventions that affect many different stakeholder groups. Peatland drainage and conversion to plantation agriculture has been associated with severe, uncontrolled peat fires that present significant climate, public health and economic risks. Peatland fire management has become a domestic and international priority, spurring intensely contentious debates, policies and legal proceedings. Previous fire management interventions (FMI) are numerous yet have suffered widespread implementation failures. Against this backdrop, our manuscript provides a thematically and methodologically novel analysis of how diverse stakeholders, from local farmers to international policy makers, perceive peatland fires in terms of, i) how they prioritize the associated benefits and burdens, and ii) the perceived effectiveness of FMI. We adopt an innovative application of Q method to provide needed insights that serve to quantify the areas of contention and consensus that exist among the stakeholders and their multi-dimensional perspectives. We show that many of the contemporary FMI were perceived as among the most effective interventions overall, but were also the most controversial between groups. Clear consensus areas were related to the shared concerns for the local health impacts and the potential of government support for fire-free alternatives as a solution pathway. Improved understanding of stakeholder perceptions has potential to: give voice to marginalized communities; enable transparent mediation of diverse priorities; inform public education campaigns, and shape future policy and governance arrangements.",0,0,0,0,0,Global Environmental Change,1,0,NA,2017,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0959378016304605,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028531209&origin=inward,8,Article,10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.08.001,0959-3780,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028531209,46,NA,50,59,109,13.63,109,1,8,NA,NA,scopus

This campaign focuses on raising public awareness about the importance of climate change adaptation efforts through concrete actions such as reforestation, waste management, and carbon footprint reduction. The method used in this research is a qualitative approach with case study analysis. Data were collected through interviews, observations, and documentation of campaign activities. The study results show that the Go Green campaign by the Pandawara Group successfully encouraged active community participation in various environmentally friendly programs. However, there are challenges to the program's sustainability, particularly related to long-term commitment and more robust policy support from the government. Therefore, this research provides several policy recommendations, including strengthening collaboration between the government, communities, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector and integrating climate change adaptation programs into regional development plans.

We find that the extension caused a large decrease in the rate of deforestation, and find suggestive evidence that these effects are concentrated in areas with greater mining potential, and where ethnic groups with strong resource-preservation norms are an electoral plurality.

This book provides a comprehensive analysis of agrarian conflicts in the context of the implementation of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and forest carbon offsetting in Indonesia, a country where deforestation is a major issue. The author analyzes new kinds of transnational agrarian conflicts which have strong implications for global environmental justice in the REDD+ pilot province of Jambi on the island of Sumatra. The chapters cover: the rescaling of the governance of forests; privatization of conservation; and the transnational dimensions of agrarian conflicts and peasants' resistance in the context of REDD+. The book builds on an innovative conceptual approach linking political ecology, politics of scale and theories of power. It fills an important knowledge and research gap by focusing on the socially differentiated impacts of REDD+ and new forest carbon offsetting initiatives in Southeast Asia, providing a multi-scalar perspective. It is aimed at scholars in the areas of political ecology, human geography, climate change mitigation, forest and natural resource management, as well as environmental justice and agrarian studies.

Over the years, legal stipulations put different levels of government in charge but the authority to manage the forests stayed with government agencies. This has been ineffective in reducing deforestation in the country and the villagers in close proximity to forests continued to live in poverty. Without property rights, they were unable to legally enjoy the benefits of forest resources and consequently were tempted to take part in illegal forest exploitation, such as poaching and illegal logging.
In recent years, the Indonesian government gradually implemented provisions of the national forestry law, granting those local communities the right to get involved in forest resource management. The villagers were required to set up a village forestry board and they had to share the profits with the state in order to be granted the right to use and access forest resources.

Sembrando Vida purports to simultaneously advance efforts to combat climate change and to enhance rural social development, and the programme leans heavily on its promise to learn from'Indigenous' and peasant'lifestyles to enhance its legitimacy. We interviewed people impacted by the Sembrando Vida project. Here, we draw on the evidence we gathered to contest its presentation as a human rights-respecting development programme, and to demonstrate that the programme is undermining traditional agroecological practices that offer a more sustainable and equitable alternative to combatting climate change. By analysing Sembrando Vida through the lens of UNDROR we demonstrate that a project thatpurports to learn from rural andpeasant communities in their stewardship of nature is a form of mandate system that seeks to nurse ruralcommunities, as opposedtofledgling nations, into a particular vision of economic health. Sembrando Vida is, predictably, remunerative for private investors and state actors trying to develop the poorer regions of Mexico through a number of disparate large-scale infrastructure projects that traverse constitutionally protected common lands.

Even when policies appear fair, the rural poor face severe biases in implementation. In addition, the poor must compete on an uneven playing field of class, ethnic and other social inequities and economic hurdles. With the development of the global forest (carbon) conservation strategy such as Reduced Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation (REDD), which is ushering in accelerated forest commodification, poor people living in forests risk further marginalisation, exclusion and rights abuses. This article examines how forestry policy and implementation maintain double standards on this uneven playing field in a manner that continues to exclude the rural poor from the natural wealth around them. Poverty is not just about being left out of economic growth. It is produced by the very policies that enable some to profit - today from timber, firewood and charcoal, tomorrow from carbon. For REDD interventions to support poverty alleviation, forestry policies must be radically reworked to counterbalance widespread regressive policies and structural asymmetries. To make forestry policy emancipatory, strong social protections or safeguards are still needed that require REDD and other interventions to support and work through local democratic institutions. Otherwise these policies will continue their regressive trends.",0,0,0,0,0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS,0,1,"IGITUR, UTRECHT PUBLISHING & ARCHIVING SERVICES",2012,NA,NA,NA,Article,NA,1875-0281,NA,6,2,233,254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience

The political decision to use or allocate resources involves balancing private rents with reelection prospects. I examine the case of deforestation in Brazil and a presidential decree granting the federal government the authority to punish counties that failed to limit total deforestation within their borders. This collective punishment aimed to generate pressure on local politicians to slow deforestation. Using binding term limits as a source of variation in reelection eligibility, I find eligibility has no effect on deforestation prior to the decree. After the decree, reelection eligible mayors reduced annual deforestation 10% more than mayors ineligible for reelection.

The use of ethnographic methods in forest areas where trustworthy state actors and institutions are not very present can also present danger and raise ethical issues (such as when the researcher, for reasons of safety, does not present as a criminological researcher).

The purpose of this paper is to revisit the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries by focusing on two indicators of environmental change (EC), namely rate of deforestation (RD) and all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Agric_GHG) with aim of addressing two key objectives in the study. First, to investigate whether the EKC hypothesis exists for both indicators considered in the region. Second, to examine the effects of macroeconomic and institutional variables on both indicators in the study.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors employ a balanced panel data covering 43 countries from 1990-2009 in the study. Subsequently, the study uses serial correlation/autoregressive order one corrected cross-section time series model based on Feasible Generalized Least Square method.
Findings
The empirical results show that the EKC exists (i.e. as inverted U-shaped) only for all GHG emissions from agriculture. Agricultural production and trade openness increase significantly both indicators of EC considered in the study. Other results show that, population growth reduces significantly Agric_GHG, while economic growth increases significantly RD in SSA.
Originality/value

Addressing the strategic role of forests as ‘carbon sinks’ and ‘service providers’ in today’s neoliberal reform projects, it contributes to a renewed attention to the material production of such (un)desired natures and their variegated realities. It argues that empirical accounts of how the reorganisation of forests is imagined, how it is implemented through specific programmes, and how it gets entangled into the multi-layered histories of people and places, are critical to understand the tensions but also the openings that neoliberal restructuring at the forested frontier entails. First, the article builds on sustained critiques of ‘green neoliberalism’ to retrace changes in global environmental politics over the last 30 years, stamped by the extended reach of the market both outward —through a performative discursive shift and quantification drives— and inward, as it now aims at subjecting practices, habits and emotions to relentless rounds of improving and enhancing. Second, it considers these developments against the background of India’s forest governance since the 1990s, which saw the emergence of the judiciary as a key institution to enforce environmental laws and countertrends to democratizing forest governance. In light of empirical data collected in the special issue, it asks to what degree instruments such as compensatory afforestation or carbon forestry constitute a departure from older forestry projects, and, in fine, the heuristics of neoliberalism as a category, taking issue with the all-powerfulness of India’s State Forest Departments, the long-standing exclusion of local communities, the use of forests as capital for elite bureaucracies, but also the currency and power of the developmental state in India.",0,0,0,0,0,Journal of South Asian Development,1,0,journals.sagepub.com,2021,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09731741211052197,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7543288675834780170&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",905,NA,10.1177/09731741211052197,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0.25,1,2,4,NA,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:CtpbqRUlr2gJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The cointegration results provide statistical evidence of long-run associations between economic growth, deforestation propensities and the quality of democracy. The elasticity estimates certify the validity of the EKC hypothesis for all the three indicators of deforestation used in this paper: forest area coverage, deforestation rate and net forest depletion rate. Moreover, controlling for democracy lowers the threshold level of growth beyond which the marginal impact of growth results in environmental betterment by reducing the deforestation propensities in Bangladesh. Moreover, democracy and economic growth are also seen to exert a combined impact on the growth-deforestation nexus. The estimated growth thresholds are above the current real GDP level of Bangladesh which reasons the nation's deforestation woes. Finally, the causality results also affirm causal associations between economic growth, deforestation and the quality of democracy.

Mining is both the major cause of deforestation and the main economic activity in the country. A simple model of the incentives to hold mining property rights is developed and tested using a unique data-set of small-scale mining property rights data. Econometric techniques are used to test the findings of the model, concluding that the number of mining rights issued fall after election years, with the number rescinded rising. The introduction of REDD+ in Guyana also seems to have increased the number of mining claims being relinquished, and reduce the number being issued. The findings highlight the importance of political economy events in the evolution of small-scale mining activity, and show some evidence that the introduction of a REDD+ framework in Guyana has impacted the main driver of deforestation, despite the absence of specific policy targeting the sector.

359,paper_1226,196,M Colchester,Self-determination or environmental determinism for indigenous peoples in tropical forest conservation,self-determination or environmental determinism for indigenous peoples in tropical forest conservation,"Advocates of people-free parks argue that human occupation of tropical forests inevitably results in a loss of biodiversity, notably through the elimination of top predators and the consequent disruption of ecosystems. Schwartzman et al.(this issue) do a good job countering this simplistic view, both by questioning its empirical basis and by arguing that protected areas need human occupants to defend them. In an increasingly globalized and liberalized world, conservationists cannot rely on beleaguered state bureaucracies to defend isolated, protected areas of high biodiversity (Colchester 1998b). Strictly protected areas need to be implanted within much larger managed landscapes occupied by human beings who also care about the environment and the well-being of future generations. The actual relations between local communities and their natural environments are, of course, extremely diverse and vary not just between societies and over time but also between different localities. Indigenous peoples, as a polythetic and self-ascribed class of human societies, may be more respectful of their local environments than most societies, owing to their close ties with their ancestral lands, their common property management regimes, and their sense of holding lands in trust for future generations (Ostrom 1990; Kempf 1993; Western & Wright 1994; Kothari et al. 1996; Stevens 1997). Conservation-ists, whatever their misgivings about the abilities of indigenous peoples to manage their environments sustainably, have to start their interventions with the reality that exists on the ground (West & Brechin 1991). It is now recognized that as many as 85% of the world's protected areas are inhabited by indigenous peoples (Alcorn 2000), and most remaining areas of tropical forests with high biodiversity are also owned or claimed by them (Weber et al. 2000). It makes more sense for conservationists to work with these peoples than to cast them into the role of environmental villains and expel them from their homelands. To choose the latter course is a sure route to social conflict and political instability (Colchester 1994; Ghimire & Pimbert 1997).
There are other compelling reasons that conservationists should collaborate with indigenous peoples, not least because to do otherwise would be to violate international law. Indigenous peoples' rights, inter alia, to the use, ownership, management, and control of their traditional lands and territories are recognized in Interna-tional Labour Organisation Convention 169 (International Labour Organisation 1989). Their right to self-determination has been acknowledged by the United Nations Subcommittee on the Elimination of Discrmination and Protection of Minorities and the United Nations Human Rights Committee (Kambel & MacKay 1999). The Convention on Biological Diversity, signed into being in 1992 and now ratified by 171 countries, likewise emphasizes the need to protect customary use of biological resources. In 1994 the World Conservation Union (1994) revised its system of protected-area categories to allow others, including indigenous peoples and not just state agencies, to own and manage protected areas. The existing and emerging rights of indigenous peoples in international law have been endorsed by mainstream conservation organisations such as the WorldWide Fund for Nature (International)(1996) and the World Conservation Union (1997a, 1997b). Recently, the World Commission on Protected Areas et al.(1999) published guidelines for recognizing indigenous rights in protected areas.",0,0,0,0,0,Conservation Biology,0,1,JSTOR,2000,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2641787,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9981775557698793734&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",210,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,196,7.84,196,1,25,https://www.academia.edu/download/66892104/84ce8d4ae30686edd7d2cbc9a8e28d390cab.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:BjFQ6PtjhooJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google
360,paper_1229,1,S Groenendijk,Shaping Community Forestry in Nepal: a solution for deforestation,shaping community forestry in nepal: a solution for deforestation,"The world’s total forest area is estimated at 30% of the total land area (FAO, 2005). However, this forest area is unevenly distributed. Two-thirds of the total forest area is concentrated in the ten most forest-rich countries (Butler, 2005). Many of the world’s forests are being threatened. FAO estimates that the world’s forests are disappearing at a rate of 13 million hectares of forest a year, which is equivalent to 3 times the total area of Holland. The depletion of forest area, also known as deforestation, is defined by (FAO, 1999; 17) as “a non-temporary change of land use from forest to other land use or depletion of forest crown cover to less than ten percent. Clear cuts (even with stump removal) if shortly followed by reforestation for forestry purposes are not considered deforestation”. Deforestation did, unfortunately, not miss out Nepal. In Nepal, about 25% of its land area is covered with forests. The Nepali forests, however, suffered a loss of 25% due to deforestation between 1990 and 2005 (Butler, 2005).
Many attempts have been done to stop the world’s deforestation process. One of these attempts is called ‘Community Forestry’(CF). As it can take many forms, there is no unique definition for the concept of ‘Community Forestry’. Its nature differs noticeably between developed and developing countries and between programs within countries. There are, however, some common characteristics. Community Forestry basically aims for site specific sustainable use and conservation of natural resources as well as to improve the livelihoods of local communities. In Community Forestry, forestry is usually small-scaled, and local communities are involved in both the planning and management of the forest. Usually, a CF project receives some financial support from governments and non-government organisations (Harrison and Suh, 2004). This relatively new strategy for forest management was proposed in the 1970s when it became clear that the former topdown, state controlled forest management approach was not beneficial to the welfare and wellbeing of local communities (Wiersum, 2004). There are many terms to refer to Community Forestry, among others; Community Based Conservation, Social Forestry, Communal Forestry, Participatory Forestry, Co-Management, Collaborative Management or Conservation and Development. Although these terms are used somewhat interchangeably, Wiersum (2004). explains a significant difference between ‘Social Forestry’and ‘Community Forestry’. He defines Social Forestry as a “development strategy of professional foresters and other development organizations with the aim of stimulating active involvement of local people in small-scale, diversified forest management activities as a means to improve the livelihood conditions of these people”. Community Forestry is, according to him, defined as “any forest management activities undertaken by rural people as part of their livelihood strategies. Such activities may be self-initiated or proposed by external development programs”. The project under which this research was carried out is best defined, using the definition above, as ‘Community Forestry’. Furthermore, as it calls itself as the ‘Nepal Swiss Community Forestry Project’(NSCFP), this report will from now on only use the term ‘Community Forestry’.",0,0,0,0,0,A study of two Community Forestry efforts in Nepal,0,1,edepot.wur.nl,2008,https://edepot.wur.nl/121108,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16345678965709745876&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",667,PDF,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0.06,1,1,17,https://edepot.wur.nl/121108,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1C60i2qE1-IJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The emergence of collaborative governance is important for the relationship between state and society in China as the central government attempt to balance between centralization and private initiatives to achieve development goals. Understanding the formation and sustainment of collaborative governance in this context can improve the utilization of this approach to support meaningful participation in governance as well as increase resilience to future social-environmental challenges. The collaboration between a Hong Kong based non-governmental organization (NGO) and the Shilou county government in western Shanxi province, China, is used as a case study for understanding this topic. This study site is located on the eastern part of the Loess Plateau, a region with continental monsoon climate and semi-arid sloped lands. I use the Collaborative Governance Regime framework to analyze how the institutional environment embedded in the system context, the drivers, and the collaborative dynamics interact with key actors to produce actions and outcomes, and how barriers that emerged before and during the collaboration were resolved.

Multiple regression techniques are applied to estimate the rate of deforestation using the level of urbanization, economic growth rate, population growth rate, level of sectoral inequality, rate of change in primary product exports, and rate of change in tertiary education. Results support modernization theory, indicating that the level of urbanization has a curvilinear effect on the rate of deforestation, that economic growth contributes to deforestation, and that sectoral inequality reduces the rate of deforestation.

The contestation has been focused on who has the right to the territory and consequently its resources. Through an examination of the dominant theoretical approaches and literature in this debate, we illuminate the different perspectives on deforestation in Brazil and their underlying assumptions. We find that the contestation over the Amazon is not just a conflict between the nation-state and the international community, rather there are many competing claims to the Amazon territory within Brazil, and the perspectives of different scholars are shaped by a number of theories and ideologies on sovereignty and the world order. This also impacts the manner in which they perceive scientific data on deforestation and climate change, which is emerging as an existential threat.

The findings suggest that imperfect decentralization and partial liberalization resulted in changed forms, rather than uniform loss, of state power. A forest co-management program paradoxically strengthened local capacity and influence of the Forest Department, which generally maintained its territorial and knowledge-based control over forests and timber management. Furthermore, deregulation and reregulation enabled the state to withdraw from uneconomic activities but also implied reduced place-based control of non-timber forest products.

The Amazon rainforest is the most varied ecosystem in terms of biodiversity and one of the major reserves of water and oxygen, it is extremely important in conserving the temperature and ecosystem stability. As part of this work, particular attention is paid to the analysis of climate change and forest conservation through the evaluation of environmental policies. The contribution of the local and indigenous communities is vital for the preservation of the rainforest but despite that, indigenous’ land, resources, and culture are threatened by the ideas which put profits ahead of nature. The thesis aims to analyze on one hand the existing instruments at national and international level and the system of institutions entrusted with the task of protecting the forest and indigenous communities and on the other hand to highlight the potential and failures of existing tools and determine the effectiveness and degree of compliance. The Amazon biome is facing a lot of challenges, if the international community and the Brazilian government do not take efficient actions to stop deforestation the rainforest will reach a point of no return in which the entire ecosystem balance would be affected.

Luiz Barbosa argues that global forces coupled with two decades of military rule in Brazil led to policies that promoted deforestation for the sake of development, ultimately having devastating consequences for Amazônia's ecosystem and its native populations. By the mid-1980s, changes in global ecopolitics and the onset of democracy in Brazil paved the way for new environmental preservation laws. Barbosa's study is unique in showing the impact of global processes on third-world environmental degradation and in its claim that democracy can facilitate preservation. The latter point is further emphasized in a comparative chapter in which Barbosa demonstrates the importance of democracy for environmental preservation in Costa Rica, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

Although decentralization is a good example of such a contextual phenomenon in multiple locations globally, it is rare to find quantitative empirical analyses of how it moderates PA effectiveness. We evaluate how the decentralization in Indonesia (proxied by the introduction of direct elections, district head (bupati) change, and district splitting) influenced PA effectiveness between 2000 and 2008. Focusing on three outcomes -deforestation, forest fragmentation, and fires, we apply a quasi-experimental approach to a carefully constructed spatially explicit village-level panel dataset, combined with geospatial biophysical and physio-geographic data. We hypothesize that the moderating influence of decentralization on PA effectiveness depends on whether decentralization increased threats to forests, strengthened local accountability, or weakened enforcement. On average, we find direct elections improved the PA impact in terms of reducing deforestation in protected villages, but had no statistically significant effect on forest fragmentation, fires, or leakage. On average, we find district splitting increased forest fragmentation in the recently protected villages, but had no statistically significant impact on deforestation and fires. On average, we find the bupati change had no statistically discernible influence on PA impacts on deforestation, fragmentation or fires. Given the increasing threats to forests due to decentralization, these results imply that district splitting and the bupati change weakened enforcement inside PAs with regards to deforestation and forest fragmentation, in contrast to direct elections. By highlighting the potential channels through which decentralization in Indonesia impacted forests, we offer insights into the effectiveness of a common conservation policy in the country. Broadly, we contribute to the conservation impact evaluation literature by quantitatively examining how political economy influences the performance of conservation policies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Political stability and corruption control do not significantly affect the income turning point but both variables shift the forest–income curve up or down. The resulting CO2 emission–income curve is downward sloping and is based on changes in the levels of variables affecting forest cover.

375,paper_1348,5,"Li, Q; Reuveny, R",The effects of liberalism on the terrestrial environment,the effects of liberalism on the terrestrial environment,"In recent decades, many countries have adopted, to various degrees, the ideologies of commercial and republican liberalism. One salient aspect of the spread of commercial liberalism in the world has been the growth in international trade. The spread of republican liberalism has manifested itself by the rise in the level of democracy in countries over time. What are the implications of trade and democracy for the terrestrial environment? Two bodies of literature are relevant to this question: one studies the effect of trade on the environment, while a second body focuses on the effect of democracy on the environment. The effects of both forces on the environment are debated theoretically and empirically. The two bodies of literature have generally developed separately, and the effects of trade and democracy have not been evaluated in the same model. This paper discusses the theoretical effects of trade and democracy on the environment, and develops a statistical model to study these effects on the terrestrial environment in the areas of deforestation and land degradation. The results indicate that a rise in trade openness reduces deforestation in autocracy and increases deforestation in democracy, and the effect is similar for the less developed countries (LDCs) and the developed countries (DCs). A rise in trade openness reduces land degradation, but the effect is not robust and does not depend on regime type. A rise in democracy increases deforestation and reduces land degradation, but these effects are weaker in LDCs than in DCs. In addition, the effect of democracy on deforestation is stronger when trade openness is high. The effect of democracy on land degradation does not depend on trade openness. The paper concludes with an examination of the implications of these results for public policy.",0,0,0,0,0,CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND PEACE SCIENCE,1,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,2007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388940701468492,NA,NA,Article,10.1080/07388940701468492,0738-8942,NA,24,3,219,238,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,webofscience
376,paper_1358,180,C Palmer,The extent and causes of illegal logging: an analysis of a major cause of tropical deforestation in Indonesia,the extent and causes of illegal logging: an analysis of a major cause of tropical deforestation in indonesia,"This paper considers the scale and underlying causes of recent high rates of deforestation in Indonesia. Its extent during 1997-98 is analysed using a materials balance model, the results of which demonstrate the seriousness of the problem at a time when the Indonesian economy was suffering the effects of the Asian financial crisis. The behaviour of the principal agents, illegal loggers, is discussed in the context of market and government failures and rent-seeking or corruption. A culture of corruption originated at the top of government during the tenure of ex- President Suharto, leading to market and government failures in the forestry sector, thus resulting in the creation of high levels of rent. A culture of corruption ensures that policy failures cannot be reversed and may lead to further intervention to benefit the status quo. Rent-seeking behaviour then spread to all levels of government, via a lack of good example at the top, leading to the creation of illegal logging networks. Since rent from illegal logging is higher than that for legal logging, there is an incentive for agents to ignore costs associated with sustainable forest management. Illegal logging, and hence inefficient resource use, is further encouraged by institutional failures such as weak enforcement and monitoring capacity, as well as policy failures at the international level too. Consequently, Indonesia’s forests have been intensively deforested for perhaps as long as 30 years, with little or no attention given to sustainable forest management.",0,0,0,0,0,NA,1,1,discovery.ucl.ac.uk,2001,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/17588/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=386348439565200180&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",113,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,180,7.5,180,1,24,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/17588/1/17588.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:NGvP29uVXAUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Price of commodities such as beef and soya, and incoming migration are paramount factors. Construction of new highways is a key aspect, as they enable a growing flow of people and economic activities, provoking an intensification of the conversion of forests into pasture and agricultural areas. The pavement of road BR-163 accelerates the expansion of the agricultural frontier from the state of Mato Grosso to Pará, inside the Amazon. Today, the Brazilian government applies two main kinds of policies to protect the environment. First by establishing conservation units (CUs) that include an array of reserve types from natural areas to indigenous lands, and second by enforcing the Forest Code (FC), a law that limits the occupation and use of forests. Legal reserve requirements for rural properties are 80% in the Amazon rainforest, 35% in the Cerrado shrublands and 20% in other regions. However, the effectiveness of these policies relies on a fragile institutional capacity, which causes a flawed monitoring, law enforcement and control. To assess the impact of effective conservation policies on land use and deforestation by 2020, we used the LUSMAPA model in combination with two scenarios, one that included different commodity price developments and migration rates and one on the assumption of the institutional strength to uphold the conservation policies. A revision of the FC from an average 80% policy target to 60% effective implementation and disregard borders of CUs by allowing 5% deforestation in CUs, that both corresponds to a ‘weak’ governmental enforcement, leads to additional deforestation of 41–57%, depending on the commodity price scenario. The results of the simulations are discussed in the light of recent policy changes in Brazil.",1,0,0,0,0,Land use policy,0,1,Elsevier,2014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837712001913,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13974803332655402138&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",330,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,105,9.55,21,5,11,https://www.academia.edu/download/50484842/The_impact_of_commodity_price_and_conser20161122-6498-epxyp5.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:msze4JZ58MEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

To account for the enforcement of environmental laws in decentralized systems, this article proposes a multilevel approach that highlights the importance of national laws and subnational implementation rules to the politics of enforcement. This approach contrasts with prominent scholarship that focuses on sanctions and the electoral incentives and bureaucratic resources of enforcers. The advantages of the multilevel approach are demonstrated by the enforcement of the native forest protection regime (NFPR) in the Argentine Chaco Forest, which is shaped not only by whether sanctions on illegal deforestation are applied by subnational authorities but also by the design of both the national law and subnational regulations. The article employs quantitative data and case studies based on extensive fieldwork to show how affected subnational organized interests influenced the design of the NFPR and the provincial regulations that weaken or strengthen enforcement.",0,0,0,0,0,Politics and Society,1,1,NA,2020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077153403&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85077153403&origin=inward,76,Article,10.1177/0032329219894074,0032-3292,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85077153403,48,1,3,26,17,3.4,17,1,5,NA,NA,scopus

The rates of deforestation have been lower than elsewhere in the tropics, and the driving forces evident in other places, government new land settlement schemes and industrialized agriculture, have largely been absent in SSA. The context and causes for African deforestation become clearer through an analysis of new, national-level data on forest cover change for SSA countries for the 2000–2005 period. The recent dynamic in SSA varies from dry to wet biomes. Deforestation occurred at faster rates in nations with predominantly dry forests. The wetter Congo basin countries had lower rates of deforestation, in part because tax receipts from oil and mineral industries in this region spurred rural to urban migration, declines in agriculture and increased imports of cereals from abroad. In this respect, the Congo basin countries may be experiencing an oil and mineral fuelled forest transition. Small farmers play a more important role in African deforestation than they do in southeast Asia and Latin America, in part because small-scale agriculture remains one of the few livelihoods open to rural peoples.",0,0,0,0,0,â€¦ Transactions of the Royal Society B â€¦,1,1,royalsocietypublishing.org,2013,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2012.0405,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1683603025830195392&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",193,NA,10.1098/rstb.2012.0405,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,298,24.83,298,1,12,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2012.0405,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:wLBhKQhcXRcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

It first considers the lowland processes of horizontal expansion that carried on until the end of the Second World War, at which point the lowlands had become almost completely deforested. The article then turns to the highland forests, and discusses the development policies pursued there by the Thai government until the 1980s, when authorities outlawed logging and declared a closure of the frontier. Drawing on political ecology, the paper argues that forest policies of the Thai government have changed owing to shifts in the relative influence of different groups - the landed nobility, the industrialists, the military, and the environmentalists - in the national political arena. The group with the least political power, the ethnic minorities living in the highlands, is eventually blamed for the deforestation, in spite of the fact that it is the one that least contributed to it.",0,0,0,0,0,Geography,1,1,Taylor &Francis,2005,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00167487.2005.12094135,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10492837207721133692&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",76,NA,10.1080/00167487.2005.12094135,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,69,3.45,69,1,20,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Claudio-Delang/publication/283797332_The_Political_Ecology_of_Deforestation_in_Thailand/links/58a64ecd4585150402ee0560/The-Political-Ecology-of-Deforestation-in-Thailand.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:fEY41NgLnpEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

As a commodity crop that prospers in tropical environments, oil palm has become controversial for its role as a driver of deforestation and social conflict, especially in main producer countries in Southeast Asia. As suitable land for oil palm production in Southeast Asia is depleting, companies have begun to look to new production frontiers, such as Latin America. Colombia and Peru have the highest percentage growth in the sector in recent years, and the crop has become a dominant strategy for development in the Peruvian Amazon. Between 2000 and 2015, 40,000 hectares of old growth forest have been cleared for large oil palm plantations in Peru. Company-Community partnerships (CCPs) have been advanced as a potentially more socially and environmentally sustainable strategy, through their alleged capacity to provide greater productivity and more efficient land use on smallholder farms. This paper describes the social, political and deforestation impact of an oil palm CCP at the forest frontier in the Peruvian Amazon. An interdisciplinary and mixed methods research approach was employed, including long-term ethnographic work and visual measurement remote sensing of land use change on 2447 hectares of smallholder land in four villages/communities. The results show that the recent arrival of powerful private companies has caused a major socio-ecological shift on the ground, particularly through the CCP. On comparing participating farms to non-participating farms, we find significant deforestation 'spillage' out of the plantation into participating farms. A major underlying driver of the negative outcomes of the CCP is the neoliberal policy approach employed by the Peruvian government, which has outsourced basic rural public works to private companies. We conclude by discussing how a more socially and environmentally just oil palm production strategy in Peru and elsewhere might look.",0,0,0,0,0,World Development,1,1,Elsevier,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18301207,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=5051269237840142599&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",70,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,84,12,28,3,7,https://www.academia.edu/download/87274356/2018_Paltan_The-Political-Ecology-of-Oil-Palm-Company-Community-partnerships-in-the-Peruvian-Amazon.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:B-FR6pu2GUYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Based on a descriptive and explanatory methodology and utilizing the political economy approach, this study aims to answer how do political and economic factors influence deforestation and restrain the implementation of forest rules and policies in Bangladesh? The finding indicates that though Bangladesh has ample forest policies, effective implementation is now restrained as timber merchants and immoral political bigwigs supported by corrupted government forest officials of the Department of Forest are closely involved in the illicit wood cutting.

387,paper_1421,161,J Purdy,"The politics of nature: climate change, environmental law, and democracy","the politics of nature: climate change, environmental law, and democracy","Legal scholars' discussions of climate change assume that the issue is one mainly of engineering incentives, and that ""environmental values"" are too weak, vague, or both to spur political action to address the emerging crisis. This Article gives reason to believe otherwise. The major natural resource and environmental statutes, the acts creating national forests and parks to the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, have emerged from exactly the activity that discussions of climate change neglect: democratic argument over the value of the natural world and its role in competing ideas of national purpose, citizenship, and the role and scale of government. This Article traces several major episodes in those developments: the rise of a Romantic attachment to spectacular places, a utilitarian ideal of rational management of resources, the legal and cultural concept of ""wilderness,"" and the innovation of ""the environment"" as a centerpiece of public debate at the end of the 1960s. The article connects each development to changes in background culture and values and the social movements and political actors that brought them into public debate and, eventually legislation. The result is both a set of specific studies and the outlines of an account of the ways in which the argument and self-interpretation of a democratic community have created and contested new ideas of ""nature"" throughout American political history. The Article then shows how past episodes cast light on the present: today's climate politics, including the seemingly anomalous (even ""irrational"") choices by municipalities to adopt the Kyoto carbon-emissions goals, make most sense when understood as extensions of a long tradition of political argument about nature, which does not simply take ""interests"" as fixed, but changes both interests and values by changing how citizens understand themselves, the country, and the natural world.",0,0,0,0,0,Yale LJ,1,1,HeinOnline,2009,https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/ylr119&section=38,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4378291975413141062&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",824,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,161,10.06,161,1,16,https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2743&context=faculty_scholarship,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Ro5xvVrRwjwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

In such criticism he aims neither to dismiss the dangers of global climate change nor to derogate the findings of ongoing scientific research, like that done by the co-awardees of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, namely, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Rather, it is meant to begin a more pointed reassessment of how today's global climate-change debates are too entwined in the reproduction of most existing power relations and global market exchange. At best, Gore's work seems essentially to ‘greenwash’ existing networks of corporate organization and expert technocracy with renewed institutional legitimacy that only rinses today's unsustainable economic status quo in the refreshing, but not fully cleansing, waters of sustainable development ideology. While there is a need for systemic reforms in economic production, government regulation, technological innovation, and social distribution to mitigate climate change, Gore's many engagements with big business, venture capital, and global media do not appear to offer such a radical transformation.

389,paper_1450,434,PM Fearnside,The roles and movements of actors in the deforestation of Brazilian Amazonia,the roles and movements of actors in the deforestation of brazilian amazonia,"Containing the advance of deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia requires understanding the roles and movements of the actors involved. The importance of different actors varies widely among locations within the region, and also evolves at any particular site over the course of frontier establishment and consolidation. Landless migrants have significant roles in clearing the land they occupy and in motivating landholders to clear as a defense against invasion or expropriation. Colonists in official settlements and other small farmers also are responsible for substantial amounts of clearing, but ranchers constitute the largest component of the region’s clearing. This group is most responsive to macroeconomic changes affecting such factors as commodity prices, and also receives substantial subsidies. Ulterior motives, such as land speculation and money laundering, also affect this group. Drug trafficking and money laundering represent strong forces in some areas and help spread deforestation where it would be unprofitable based only on the legitimate economy. Goldminers increase the population in distant areas and subsequently enter the ranks of other groups. Work as laborers or debt slaves provides an important entry to the region for poor migrants from northeast Brazil, providing cheap labor to large ranches and a large source of entrants to other groups, such as landless farmers and colonists. Capitalized farmers, including agribusiness for soy production, have tremendous impact in certain areas, such as Mato Grosso. This group responds to commodity markets and provides justification for major infrastructure projects. Landgrabbers, or grileiros, are important in entering public land and beginning the process of deforestation and transfer of land to subsequent groups of actors. These include sawmill owners and loggers, who play an important role in generating funds for clearing by other groups, ranging from landless migrants to large ranchers. They also build endogenous roads, facilitating the entry of other actors. Future movements of actors will be influenced by major infrastructure plans, such as those for hydroelectric dams.
Policies for reducing deforestation must include removing motives for deforestation by stopping the practice of regularizing land claims and by cutting subsidies.

Movement to the frontier needs to be discouraged by exercising restraint in approving infrastructure such as highways, and by creating and protecting conservation units.

However, law enforcement interventions that seek to prevent deforestation rarely have been evaluated. Conservationists increasingly recognize the need to measure the effectiveness of their interventions, using an indicator of biodiversity change, such as rate of deforestation, and a counterfactual approach that addresses a fundamental question: what would have happened had there been no intervention? This study examines how law enforcement can mitigate habitat loss from small-holder coffee growing by comparing 34 years of empirical data on deforestation rates and coffee prices across a zone of high law enforcement and a zone of low law enforcement using satellite imagery, ecological data, interviews, and GIS modeling. In the early 1980s strong law enforcement efforts were found to reduce deforestation inside Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP), southwest Sumatra. However, law enforcement efforts were weak in remote areas of BBSNP, where high coffee prices spurred rapid deforestation. Furthermore, law enforcement efforts were reversed by the 1997–1998 Asian economic crisis, the fall of the national president, and by new regulations surrounding regional autonomy. These findings indicate that law enforcement is critical but insufficient alone. They also highlight that rising costs of agricultural commodities can be detrimental to tropical forests and their associated biodiversity. In the long run one must act to decrease the incentives for coffee cultivation.

We analyze such a campaign in the Peruvian Amazon, where more than 1,200 indigenous communities comprising some 11 million ha have been titled since the mid-1970s. We use community-level longitudinal data derived from high-resolution satellite images to estimate the effect of titling between 2002 and 2005 on contemporaneous forest clearing and disturbance. Our results indicate that titling reduces clearing by more than three-quarters and forest disturbance by roughly two-thirds in a 2-y window spanning the year title is awarded and the year afterward.

This paper is commendable for its theme per se (tropical deforestation generates multiple threats to humanity), its method (pantropical spatial and long-term patterns), the quality of data, and the sophisticated hierarchical generalized additive models (HGAM) applied. But ‘is the job (indeed) done?’ to quote Clinton's successor in the Presidency. Three remarks complementing the authors' core thesis might be of interest.
First, a reader might be confused after results showing deforestation rates (or %) significantly lower in election years than in non-election years (Table 2, p. 6) vs. the final concluding paragraph (p. 8), where the opposite is stated with emphasis on a partial result on competitive election years compared to non-competitive election years (Fig. 3, p. 7). Following the extended and exemplary literature and discussion of the authors, one might wonder whether elections per se, i.e., the substantiation of Democracy, play any role punctual might in driving deforestation, or is it bad governance as a regime violating central or acceptable norms of a State of Law and policy-making that maintains an environmentally unfavorable relationship between those who govern and those who are headed.

In a region that was the last Khmer Rouge stronghold, the opening of former conflict zones after a peace agreement initiated a vast movement of agricultural colonization. This movement was economically triggered by high market demand for agricultural commodities such as maize and cassava and fueled by a massive flow of spontaneous in-migration of land-poor farmers from lowland regions around the entire country. Focused on four upland districts along a pioneer front of Northwestern Cambodia, we analyzed historical trajectories of land use/cover changes using a chronological series of Landsat data from 1976 to 2016. We identified key drivers of deforestation using demographic data and qualitative information from local actors and other relevant stakeholders. We found a 65 percent forest cover loss due to conversion by smallholders into agricultural land for maize and cassava cultivation over a period of 15 years. The underlying mechanisms of land use change were further investigated to understand the diversity of individual farm trajectories and decision-making processes in relation to land conversion.

We found that forests are more likely to be cleared in locations where the economic returns to agriculture are higher, due to either more favorable climatologic and topographic conditions or lower costs of clearing forests and transporting products to markets. Timber activity, land tenure security, community forest management, and community demographics are not consistently associated with either higher or lower deforestation. Population is consistently associated with greater deforestation and poverty is consistently associated with lower deforestation. However, in both cases it is difficult to infer a causal link because of endogeneity. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, we suggest promising approaches for stopping deforestation, including reducing the expansion of road networks into remote forested areas, targeting protected areas in regions where forests face a greater threat, and insulating the forest frontier from the demand for agricultural commodities.

Understanding the determinants of deforestation at the household level is critical for conservation policies and sustainable development. We explore the drivers of household deforestation decisions, focusing on the quality of the forest resources (timber volumepotential)andtheinstitutionalenvironment(conservationstrategies,titling,andgovernmental grants). Both aspects are hypothesized to influence deforestation, but there is little empirical evidence. Weaddress the following questions: (i) Does timber availability attract more deforestation? (ii) Do conservation strategies (incentive-based programs in the Central Amazon and protected areas in the Chocó-Darién) influence deforestation decisions in household located outside the areas under conservation? (iii) Does the absence of titling increase the odds of a household to deforest? (iv) Can governmental grants for poverty alleviation help in the fight against deforestation? We estimated a logit model, where the dependent variable reflects whether or not a household cleared forest within the farm. As predictors, we included the above variables and controlled by household-specific characteristics. This study was conducted in the Central Amazon and the Chocó-Darién of Ecuador, two major deforestation fronts in the country. We found that timber volume potential is associated with a higher odds of deforesting in the Central Amazon, but with a lower odds in the Chocó-Darién. Althoughconservation strategies can influence household decisions, the effects are context-dependent. Households near the incentive-based program (Central Amazon) have a lower odds of deforesting, whereas households near a protected area (Chocó-Darién) showed the opposite effect. Titling is also important for deforestation reduction; more attention is needed in the Chocó-Darién where numerous households are living in untitled lands. Finally, governmental grants for poverty alleviation showed the potential to generate positive environmental outcomes.",1,0,0,0,0,Forests,1,1,mdpi.com,2020,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/11/1131,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10437805273373474117&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",582,HTML,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,1.8,2,5,5,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/11/1131,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Rf0fIpiI2pAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

The case of the Philippines,what drives the success of reforestation projects in tropical developing countries? the case of the philippines,"In response to substantial deforestation over many decades, large scale reforestation programs are being implemented across many tropical developing countries. Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5 million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods, diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical developing countries.

Climate change, policy responses, and redistributed forests in the twenty-first century","whither the forest transition? climate change, policy responses, and redistributed forests in the twenty-first century","Forest transitions occur when net reforestation replaces net deforestation in places. Because forest transitions can increase biodiversity and augment carbon sequestration, they appeal to policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss and climate change. What then can policymakers do to trigger forest transitions? The historical record over the last two centuries provides insights into the precipitating conditions. The early transitions often occurred passively, through the spontaneous regeneration of trees on abandoned agricultural lands. Later forest transitions occurred more frequently after large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred governments to take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped lands. To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with clearly articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover. These historical shifts in forest transitions reflect our growing appreciation of their utility for countering droughts, floods, land degradation, and climate change.",0,0,0,0,0,Ambio,1,1,Springer,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-018-01143-0,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9872032228953238552&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en",645,NA,10.1007/s13280-018-01143-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,120,24,20,6,5,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6888783/pdf/13280_2018_Article_1143.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:GCz3CQKBAIkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22elections%22%7C%22democracy%22%7C%22leader+selection%22%7C%22campaign%22%7C%22political+cycle%22+%22deforestation%22%7C%22forest+conversion%22%7C%22forest+plantation%22%7C%22forest+conservation%22%7C%22forest+degradation%22%7C%22reforestation%22%7C%22forest+carbon%22%7C%22tree+cover+loss%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_ylo=1990&as_yhi=2025",google

Wataru,"Wipe away the notoriety: ""Sustainable forest management policy"" in the context of Sarawak society","wipe away the notoriety: ""sustainable forest management policy"" in the context of sarawak society","Southeast Asia has a rich ecosystem of tropical forest that has been rapidly degraded. Malaysian Sarawak, like other areas in Southeast Asia, is the target of international criticism for commercial logging that causes deforestation and destroys native people's livelihood. In fact, Sarawak still maintains a large portion of forested area and deforestation is not rapid compared to other areas in Southeast Asia. Abuse of minority people, who depend on the forests, through logging and development projects, is also commonly found in Southeast Asia. Therefore, it seems that commercial logging in Sarawak has been among the most criticized in Southeast Asia not only because of its environment impact, but also because of Sarawak's social and political framework. This article examines the socio-political structure in relation to forest resources in Sarawak and considers recent changes in both NGO and government policy. Since the late 1980s, the Penan, a native people in the Upper Baram and Limban river basin, have blockaded logging roads to protest commercial logging. This movement attracted the commitment of foreign environmental activists to the international anti-logging campaign. Domestic NGOs alone were not powerful and easily suppressed by the government. The urban middle class is divided into ethnic clusters. Therefore, environmental degradation and the thread to Penan's livelihood caused by the commercial logging did not become a public issue in Sarawak, and the Penan had to rely on foreign activists. Recently some changes are apparent. In the 1990s, the Sarawak government introduced a ""Sustainable Forest Management"" policy, including application for MTCC timber certification that actually started in 2002. NGOs and the native people's movement have shifted from physical methods, such as blockades, to waging legal battles, and more local NGOs are assisting native people. A major issue is still the government policy that does not recognize native customary rights in the natural forests. But it is also necessary to find temporary and practical solutions to improve native livelihood. For that purpose, persistent dialogue among all concerned should be continued.",0,0,0,0,0,Southeast Asian Studies,0,1,NA,2008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58149488845&origin=inward,https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58149488845&origin=inward,95,Article,NA,0563-8682,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/58149488845,46,2,255,275,0,0,0,1,17,NA,NA,scopus

However, these studies neglect the role that women’s NGOs potentially play in this process. We seek to address this gap by conducting a cross-national study of the association between women’s NGOs and deforestation. We examine this relationship because deforestation often translates into increased household labor, loss of income, and impaired health for women and, as a result, women’s non-governmental organizations have become increasingly involved in dealing with these problems often by protecting forests. We use data from a sample of 61 nations for the period of 1990–2005. We find substantial support for world polity theory that both high levels of women’s and environmental NGOs per capita are associated with lower rates of deforestation. We also find that high levels of debt service and structural adjustment are correlated with higher rates of forest loss.
