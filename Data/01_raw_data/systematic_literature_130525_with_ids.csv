In particular, it explores the meaning of its guiding maxim, Minimum Government, Maximum Governance', by analysing specific reforms and broader changes in state-society relations. First, the Modi government has imposed greater discipline in public administration through a personalistic, centralised and technocratic style of rule. But it has bolstered executive power by limiting political transparency, parliamentary government and social dissent. Second, the new government has promoted urbanisation, manufacturing and infrastructure through greater economic liberalisation, public investment and institutional reform. Yet it has weakened many labour protocols, environmental regulations and participatory mechanisms regarding land acquisition and forest conservation. Lastly, the Modi administration has introduced new insurance schemes and championed digitally-enabled cash transfers to deliver social entitlements. However, it has reduced public spending on primary education and basic health, and undercut many rights-based welfare acts introduced by the previous administration, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). These three trends have narrowed the spaces of power and contestation in contemporary Indian democracy, frustrating the promise of maximum governance'.",NA,NA,"webofscience","'minimum government, maximum governance': the restructuring of power in modi's india","paper_7"

The convective development during 7 February 1999 is shown to occur during a period of very weak large-scale forcing in the presence of topography and deforestation. The available data include dual Doppler radar analysis, radiosonde launches, and surface and boundary layer observations. The observational analysis is complemented with a series of model simulations using the RAMS with 2-km resolution over a 300 km 300 km area forced by a morning radiosonde profile. A comparison of the observed and simulated thermodynamic transformation of the boundary layer and of the formation of convective lines, and of their kinematic and microphysical properties is presented. It is shown that only a few very deep and intense convective cells are necessary to explain the overall precipitating line formation and that discrete propagation and coupling with upper atmosphere circulations may explain the appearance of several lines. The numerical simulation indicates that topography may be the cause of initial convective development, although later on the convective line is parallel to the midlevel shear. There are indications that small-scale deforestation may have an effect on increasing rainfall in the wet season when the large-scale forcing is very weak.",NA,NA,"webofscience","a case study of convective organization into precipitating lines in the southwest amazon during the wetamc and trmm-lba","paper_16"

Effective strength depends on the strength of a group, how well it transmits its pressures and the level of public support, all of which are linked to progress in democratization and pluralization. External pressures may change stated policy but not actual policy. Forest policy evolution is divided into three phases: exploitative (when both actual and stated policies promote exploitation), ambiguous (stated policy promotes sustainable management but actual policy remains exploitative) and sustainable management (both actual and stated policies promote sustainable management). The model is tested by applying it to the Philippines, where a sharp rise in the relative power of protectionist groups and their ability to exert pressures on government, and a significant increase in democracy and pluralism, coincided with a major change in forest policy in 1986. Progress in controlling deforestation and managing forest more sustainably throughout the tropics may therefore depend on similar political changes occurring on a larger scale. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Today this social movement is still alive and kicking. In 2010, the Aru Islands community was taken by surprise by the plan of a private corporation (PT Menara Group or PT MG) to annex forest areas in the Aru Islands in order to convert them into sugar-cane plantations. Their outrage at this plan spurred the citizens of Aru to fight the might of this corporate and preserve their forests and environment. Not all has gone smoothly as the civil society movement in Aru has been divided into pro-splitting and counter-splitting on a regional division agenda. Meanwhile, this exploitative business has become a scourge for the Aru people who want to preserve their forests and the environment as a whole. Thanks to the campaign, environmental awareness appears to be growing rather than abating among the Aru Islands community. Young people in the Aru have been sharing their stories about the natural resources around them under threat from the power of private corporate capital with friends, family, and neighbours. The danger of deforestation by private corporations is a problem and a challenge that must be faced by all communities, whether they be Aru, Indonesian, or international, who care about the preservation of the forests in the Aru Islands as a lung of the world, helping to reduce the effects of global warming and the ozone depletion.",NA,NA,"webofscience","a reflection on a peripheral movement the save aru social movement 2013-2015 from a historical perspective","paper_44"

Biomass reflects the health and environmental conditions of a forest ecosystem. In context to the climate change mitigation mechanisms like REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an extensive forest monitoring campaign is especially important. Remote sensing of forest structure and biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bears significant potential for mapping and understanding forest ecological processes. Limitations of the conventional forest inventory procedures, like the extensive cost, labor and time, can be overcome through integrated geospatial techniques. Optical sensor or SAR data are suitable for extracting information about simple and homogeneous forest stand sites. However, optical sensors face serious limitations, specifically in tropical regions, like the cloud cover that SAR can overcome along with targeting saturation and penetration aspects. Simultaneous use of spectral information and image texture parameters improves the biomass assessment over undulating terrain and in radical conditions. Also, synergic use of multi-sensor optical and SAR has better potential than single sensor. Interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) SAR or a combination of the both (PolInSAR) serves as effective alternatives. These techniques could serve as valuable methods for biomass assessment of heterogeneous complex biophysical environments. However, SAR data have its own limitations and complexities. Identifying, understanding and solving major uncertainties in different stages of the biomass estimation procedure are critical. In this regard, the current study provides a review of radar remote sensing-based studies in forest biomass estimation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","a review of radar remote sensing for biomass estimation","paper_46"

Our method offers the advantage of detecting small-scale deforestation without resorting to spatial filtering techniques, thus preserving the native spatial resolution of the Sentinel-1 measurements. To assess its effectiveness, we conducted comparative evaluations against existing operational deforestation monitoring systems. The validation campaign revealed that our method exhibits enhanced detection performance with low false alarm rates with respect to existing systems across diverse landscapes, including dense forest regions such as the Brazilian Amazon, as well as seasonality-dependent areas like the Cerrado, which is strongly under-monitored by existing technology. This robustness stems from the sequential adaptive process inherent in our approach, which enables effective monitoring even in the presence of backscatter variations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","a statistical method for near real-time deforestation monitoring using time series of sentinel-1 images","paper_51"

The project was developed following the criteria of environmental, technical, social and economic sustainability to propose a shared model, reproducible by the beneficiaries living in different kinds of Mosquitian ecosystems. Increased building efficiency is obtained through optimization of construction techniques and improvement of materials' performances. The main material of the proposed dwelling is wood, coherently with the Miskita tradition; the increase of its durability, which is obtained by proper seasoning and protection from atmospheric agents and parasites, contributes to the optimization of the use of this natural resource and to reducing the impact on deforestation, which threatens forest biodiversity. The data collection campaign, conducted before developing the housing model design and which has aimed at obtaining information on technical and social aspects related to residences' welfare and health conditions, has highlighted the great importance of improving the construction model. Despite the advance in sanitary conditions and the economic level, the data collection campaign revealed that even the most developed communities amongst those visited have been perpetrating substantial construction errors, which reduce the resilience of structures to extreme natural phenomena, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which frequently affect the Mosquitia region.

The aim of TERENO is to foster the understanding of water, energy, and matter fluxes in terrestrial systems, as well as their biological and physical drivers. Part of the Lower Rhine Valley-Eifel observatory of TERENO is located within the Eifel National Park. Recently, the National Park forest management started to promote the natural regeneration of near-natural beech forest by removing a significant proportion of the spruce forest that was established for timber production after World War II. Within this context, the effects of such a disturbance on forest ecosystem functioning are currently investigated in a deforestation experiment in the Wustebach catchment, which is one of the key experimental research sites within the Lower Rhine Valley-Eifel observatory. Here, we present the integrated observation system of the Wustebach test site to exemplarily demonstrate the terrestrial observatory concept of TERENO that allows for a detailed monitoring of changes in hydrological and biogeochemical states and fluxes triggered by environmental disturbances. We present the observation platforms and the soil sampling campaign, as well as preliminary results including an analysis of data consistency. We specifically highlight the capability of integrated datasets to enable improved process understanding of the post-deforestation changes in ecosystem functioning.",NA,NA,"webofscience","a terrestrial observatory approach to the integrated investigation of the effects of deforestation on water, energy, and matter fluxes","paper_58"

A total of 15 plots were surveyed during the field campaign and locally developed tree species-specific allometric equation was used for AGB calculation. The SAR images were pre-processed and calibrated to sigma nought (dB) for statistical AGB modeling. Nonlinear regression models between field-based AGB (ton/ha) and SAR backscatter sigma nought (dB) values give R-2 (0.47 and 0.55) and RMSE (1.18 and 1.87) values for HH and HV-pol data, respectively. AGB maps generated through these regression models from both HH and HV-pol data show similar AGB values and spatial patterns. Due to a small number of sample plots, the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) proxy validation method was used for model validation, between estimated and predicted backscatter sigma nought (dB) values.

Recent initiatives to evaluate the feasibility of malaria eradication have highlighted impacts of landscape changes on malaria transmission and the potential of these changes to undermine malaria control and elimination efforts. Multisectoral approaches are needed to detect and minimize negative impacts of land use and land cover changes on malaria transmission while supporting development aiding malaria control, elimination and ultimately eradication. Pathways through which land use and land cover changes disrupt social and ecological systems to increase or decrease malaria risks are outlined, identifying priorities and opportunities for a global malaria eradication campaign. The impacts of land use and land cover changes on malaria transmission are complex and highly context-specific, with effects changing over time and space. Landscape changes are only one element of a complex development process with wider economic and social dimensions affecting human health and wellbeing. While deforestation and other landscape changes threaten to undermine malaria control efforts and have driven the emergence of zoonotic malaria, most of the malaria elimination successes have been underpinned by agricultural development and land management. Malaria eradication is not feasible without addressing these changing risks while, conversely, consideration of malaria impacts in land management decisions has the potential to significantly accelerate progress towards eradication. Multisectoral cooperation and approaches to linking malaria control and environmental science, such as conducting locally relevant ecological monitoring, integrating landscape data into malaria surveillance systems and designing environmental management strategies to reduce malaria burdens, are essential to achieve malaria eradication.",NA,NA,"webofscience","achieving global malaria eradication in changing landscapes","paper_66"

First, as human rights and democracy are seen as politically sensitive issues in Vietnam, FPIC is likely to be more accepted by the government if it is built upon the national legal framework on citizen rights. Applying FPIC in this context can ensure that both government and citizen's interests are achieved within the permitted political space. Second, FPIC activities should be seen as a learning process and designed based on local needs and preferences, with accountability of facilitators, two-way and multiple communication strategies, flexibility, and collective action in mind.",NA,NA,"webofscience","adapting free, prior, and informed consent (fpic) to local contexts in redd+: lessons from three experiments in vietnam","paper_69"

We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders. ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bio-slurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods. Households perceive higher crop yields (84%-91% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%-94% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%-91% of users). Benefits most appreciated are easy cooking and saving time and money. Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters. The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use.

Emission ratios for aerosol number (CN) relative to CO (ERCN/CO) fell in the range 14-32 cm(-3) ppb(-1) in most of the investigated smoke plumes. Particle number emission ratios have to our knowledge not been previously measured in tropical deforestation fires, but our results are in agreement with values usually found from tropical savanna fires. The number of particles emitted per amount biomass burned was found to be dependent on the fire conditions (combustion efficiency). Variability in ERCN/CO between fires was similar to the variability caused by variations in combustion behavior within each individual fire. This was confirmed by observations of CO-to-CO2 emission ratios (ERCO/CO2), which stretched across the same wide range of values for individual fires as for all the fires observed during the sampling campaign, reflecting the fact that flaming and smoldering phases are present simultaneously in deforestation fires. Emission factors (EF) for CO and aerosol particles were computed and a correction was applied for the residual smoldering combustion (RSC) fraction of emissions that are not sampled by the aircraft, which increased the EF by a factor of 1.5-2.1. Vertical transport of smoke from the boundary layer (BL) to the cloud detrainment layer (CDL) and the free troposphere (FT) was found to be a very common phenomenon. We observed a 20% loss in particle number as a result of this vertical transport and subsequent cloud processing, attributable to in-cloud coagulation. This small loss fraction suggests that this mode of transport is very efficient in terms of particle numbers and occurs mostly via non-precipitating clouds. The detrained aerosol particles released in the CDL and FT were larger than in the unprocessed smoke, mostly due to coagulation and secondary growth, and therefore more efficient at scattering radiation and nucleating cloud droplets. This process may have significant atmospheric implications on a regional and larger scale.",NA,NA,"webofscience","airborne measurements of trace gas and aerosol particle emissions from biomass burning in amazonia","paper_85"

The energy balance closure ratio (EBR) was 105% for a homogeneous camelina site, 86% at a sparse reforestation site, and 73% for a vineyard. We hypothesize that the lower closure in the last site was related to the limited fetch. Incorporating a vertical gradient of soil thermal properties decreased the RMSE of the energy balance at the camelina site by 16 W m(-2). At the camelina site, eddy covariance estimates of sensible and latent heat fluxes could be reproduced well using mean vertical profiles of wind and temperature, provided that the Monin-Obukhov length is known. Measured surface temperature and sensible heat fluxes suggested high excess resistance for heat (kB(-1) = 17).",NA,NA,"webofscience","an analysis of turbulent heat fluxes and the energy balance during the reflex campaign","paper_95"

The analysis is based on interviews and questionnaires of those involved in the campaigns, as well as a review of related published and unpublished documents. The results show that the target company has become more sustainable since the campaigns started, though is still failing on certain issues. These findings are supported by some Environmental Non-Government Organisations (ENGOs), although others strongly believe that the company has made no progress at all and is still involved in illegal and unsustainable practices.

Although several inventories of biomass burning emissions cover Brazil, there are still considerable uncertainties and differences among them. While most fire emission inventories utilize the parameters of burned area, vegetation fuel load, emission factors, and other parameters to estimate the biomass burned and its associated emissions, several more recent inventories apply an alternative method based on fire radiative power (FRP) observations to estimate the amount of biomass burned and the corresponding emissions of trace gases and aerosols. The Brazilian Biomass Burning Emission Model (3BEM) and the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) are examples of the first, while the Brazilian Biomass Burning Emission Model with FRP assimilation (3BEM_FRP) and the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) are examples of the latter. These four biomass burning emission inventories were used during the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) field campaign. This paper analyzes and inter-compared them, focusing on eight regions in Brazil and the time period of 1 September-31 October 2012. Aerosol optical thickness (AOT(550aEuro-nm)) derived from measurements made by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operating on board the Terra and Aqua satellites is also applied to assess the inventories' consistency. The daily area-averaged pyrogenic carbon monoxide (CO) emission estimates exhibit significant linear correlations (r, paEuro- > aEuro-0.05 level, Student t test) between 3BEM and FINN and between 3BEM_ FRP and GFAS, with values of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively. These results indicate that emission estimates in this region derived via similar methods tend to agree with one other. However, they differ more from the estimates derived via the alternative approach. The evaluation of MODIS AOT(550aEuro-nm) indicates that model simulation driven by 3BEM and FINN typically underestimate the smoke particle loading in the eastern region of Amazon forest, while 3BEM_FRP estimations to the area tend to overestimate fire emissions. The daily regional CO emission fluxes from 3BEM and FINN have linear correlation coefficients of 0.75-0.92, with typically 20-30aEuro-% higher emission fluxes in FINN. The daily regional CO emission fluxes from 3BEM_FRP and GFAS show linear correlation coefficients between 0.82 and 0.90, with a particularly strong correlation near the arc of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In this region, GFAS has a tendency to present higher CO emissions than 3BEM_FRP, while 3BEM_FRP yields more emissions in the area of soybean expansion east of the Amazon forest. Atmospheric aerosol optical thickness is simulated by using the emission inventories with two operational atmospheric chemistry transport models: the IFS from Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) and the Coupled Aerosol and Tracer Transport model to the Brazilian developments on the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (CCATT-BRAMS). Evaluation against MODIS observations shows a good representation of the general patterns of the AOT(550aEuro-nm) time series. However, the aerosol emissions from fires with particularly high biomass consumption still lead to an underestimation of the atmospheric aerosol load in both models.",NA,NA,"webofscience","assessment of fire emission inventories during the south american biomass burning analysis (sambba) experiment","paper_144"

A major problem when estimating biomass from optical and SAR remote sensing images is the saturation effect. As a solution, PolInSAR offers a high coverage height map that can be transformed into a biomass map. Temporal decorrelation may affect the accuracy of PolInSAR and may also have an effect on the accuracy of the biomass estimates. In this study, we compared three different height estimation models: the Random-Volume-over-Ground (RVoG), Random-Motion-over-Ground (RMoG), and Random-Motion-over-Ground-Legendre (RMoG) models. The RVoG model does not take into account the temporal decorrelation, while the other two compensate for temporal decorrelation but differ in structure function. The comparison was done on 214 field plots of the 10 m radius of the BioSAR2010 campaign. Different models relating PolInSAR height and biomass were developed by using polynomial, exponential, power series, and piece-wise linear regression. Different strategies for training and test subset selection were followed to obtain the best possible regression models. The study showed that the RMoGmodel provided the most accurate biomass predictions. The relation between RMoGs height and biomass is well expressed by the exponential model with an average RMSE equal to 48 ton value equal to 0.62. The relative errors for estimated biomass were equal to 46% for the RVoG model, to 37% for the RMoG, and to 30% for the RMoG model. We concluded that taking the temporal decorrelation into account for estimating tree height has a significant effect on providing accurate biomass estimates.",NA,NA,"webofscience","assessment of forest above-ground biomass estimation from polinsar in the presence of temporal decorrelation","paper_145"

Here we systematically catalog whether second-tier governments in 30 tropical countries with high projected future emissions from deforestation possess 14 distinct types of general and forest-related authority. We compile this information in a free, open-access database. Second-tier governments have broadest authority to reduce deforestation in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Peru, China, Laos, Mozambique, and Vietnam. Second-tier governments have the least authority in Central African Republic, Gabon, Angola, Madagascar, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Venezuela. Second-tier governments have intermediate authority in Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Mexico, the Philippines, Colombia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Zambia, Mexico, and Republic of Congo. Authorities that second-tier governments most commonly possess include development planning, taxation, budgeting, and roads. Authorities that second-tier governments least commonly possess include land ownership, police, permits for mining, Indigenous affairs, and protected areas. Authorities possessed by an intermediate number of second-tier governments include spatial planning, elections, courts, and permits for agriculture. More than one-quarter of future emissions from deforestation between 2020 and 2050 is projected to come from just seven out of 678 second-tier jurisdictions: Amazonas, Para, and Mato Grosso (Brazil), equateur and Orientale (Democratic Republic of Congo), Loreto (Peru), and El Beni (Bolivia). After weighting for authority, our list of the 50 second-tier jurisdictions in the tropics that are the highest priority for reducing emissions from deforestation shifts to include fewer second-tier jurisdictions in Africa (where second-tier governments have 4.2 authorities out of 14 in the average country) and Latin America (6.3 authorities out of 14) and more second-tier jurisdictions in Asia (8.5 authorities out of 14). Second-tier jurisdictions that have formally expressed interest in reducing emissions from deforestation, e.g., through the Governors' Climate and Forest Task Force, Under2 Coalition, or New York Declaration on Forests, possess greater authority to reduce deforestation on average than other jurisdictions.

The park was established in 1992 in the context of South Africa's transition to democracy, growing ecotourism in the country and global movements towards conservation involving and benefiting local people. The paper argues that the protracted conflict between park residents and management led to new patterns of livelihood activities and household formation, and resulted in material and social differentiation amongst park households. The goals of park management, with a commitment to nature conservation and ecotourism, were at odds with the livelihood practices of park residents. Conflicts arose over stocking levels, overgrazing, wood-cutting and deforestation and over the use of other natural resources, including water and medicinal plants. The park was the site of a Rand Water project that employed many residents. Residents found themselves between a rock and a hard place as they resisted attempts by the management to reduce stocking levels and yet relied on management to gain access to sources of paid employment.",NA,NA,"webofscience","between a rock and a hard place: contested livelihoods in qwaqwa national park, south africa","paper_172"

Specifically, we argue that in return for campaign contributions, Colombian mayors who rely on donor-funding (compared with those who do not) choose not to enforce sanctions against illegal deforestation activities. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that deforestation is significantly higher in municipalities that elect donor-funded as opposed to self-funded politicians. Further analysis shows that only part of this effect can be explained by differences in contracting practices by donor-funded mayors. Instead, evidence of heterogeneity in the effects according to the presence of alternative formal and informal enforcement institutions, and analysis of fire clearance, support the interpretation that campaign contributions buy reductions in the enforcement of environmental regulations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","buying a blind eye: campaign donations, regulatory enforcement, and deforestation","paper_199"

One of the most common techniques is the use of sun dried or kiln fired adobe bricks with mud mortar. Fired bricks are the main cause for deforestation in countries like Malawi. Although this technique is low-cost, the bricks vary largely in shape, strength and durability. This leads to weak houses which suffer considerable damage during floods and seismic events. One solution is the use of dry-stack masonry with stabilized interlocking compressed earth blocks (ICEB). This technology has the potential of substituting the current bricks by a more sustainable kind of block. This study was made in the context of the HiLoTec project, which focuses on houses in rural areas of developing countries. For this study, Malawi was chosen for a case study. This paper presents the experimental results of tests made with dry-stack ICEBs. Soil samples from Malawi were taken and studied. Since the experimental campaign could not be carried out in Malawi, a homogenization process of Portuguese soil was made to produce ICEBs at the University of Minho, Portugal. Then, the compression and tensile strength of the materials was determined via small cylinder samples. Subsequently, the compression and flexural strength of units were determined. Finally, tests to determine the compressive strength of both prisms and masonry wallets and to determine the initial shear strength of the dry interfaces were carried out. This work provides valuable data for low-cost eco-efficient housing.",NA,NA,"webofscience","characterization of dry-stack interlocking compressed earth blocks","paper_237"

Pending successful completion it could represent a 10-20% increase in China's national forest area and a 10% decrease in current cultivated area. In contrast to China's other forest-sector policies, SLCP uses a public payment scheme that directly engages millions of rural households as core agents of project implementation, and has the stated principals of volunteerism. Thus, insofar as current or future de facto program implementation involves decentralized, voluntary grassroots participation, SLCP represents an important departure from business as usual in how China manages its forest resources. This work draws upon current available research of the program and uses a 2003 household and village-level survey conducted by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, CAS, to examine program design, implementation and outcomes to date. Results indicate that significant problems in design and implementation exist, with these including shortfalls in subsidies delivered, lack of respect of the principals of volunteerism, and insufficient technical support and budgeting for local implementation costs. More fundamentally, some program goals appear to be based on common misperceptions regarding the linkages between forests and watershed services. Overall, SLCP contains both innovative elements (volunteerism and the direct engagement of farmers) as well as components that hark back to policies and mindsets of decades past (the program's top-down, simplified contract structure, lack of sufficient consultation with local communities and rural households, and campaign-style mobilization). The paper concludes by providing four main suggestions to improve the program: 1) Increase local community input in design and implementation, and ensure that households have full autonomy in participation choice; 2) improve technical support and budgeting for local administrative costs and capacity building; 3) clarify the environmental services targeted and verify the measures needed to acquire these services; and 4) integrate SLCP into an overall package of complementary policies aimed at the rural sector.

This article focuses on the local institutions chosen as partners by a prominent REDD+ project in Kenya and the implications of this choice for local democracy. The REDD+ project briefly partnered with state-appointed local authorities to represent local interests, bypassing elected ones. Shortly after, the state-appointed authorities were abandoned in favour of 'project-created' carbon committees and civil society organisations. The choice to recognise some institutions while excluding others, was justified by the levels of downward accountability and of corruption, and arguments that state-sanctioned institutions were overburdened and inefficient. However, the article contends that this preference for carbon committees and civil society organisations over state-sanctioned institutions, and particularly the aversion to democratically elected ones, was not conducive for long-term strengthening of local democracy. The analysis pinpoints a tension between setting up parallel models of authority that can act as exemplars of democratic practice, while undermining democratically elected institutions that, in Kenya, are struggling to exercise newly devolved powers. Explicit strategies are required to enable learning from parallel governance models and for their migration into mainstream local governance structures, if local democracy is to be strengthened rather than undermined.",NA,NA,"webofscience","choices have consequences: redd plus and local democracy in kenya","paper_246"

To achieve this, the land cover of this protected area was determined by classifying satellite images obtained before, during and after the conflicts, and via ground surveys. Metrics of landscape ecology were calculated. A ground campaign for observing the CFHS's flora and damages incurred was carried out using a sampling of eighteen 500 m-long transects. The results show that forest fragmentation intensified during and after the period of conflicts. Forests covered over 93% of the CFHS's area before conflicts and under 28% in 2015. The main cause of this deforestation is cacao growing. Anthropic activities caused the loss of 40% of plant species, including some which are endemic in Ivory Coast. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We use remote sensing data on forest fires and remaining tree cover to estimate the effectiveness of a project targeted at reducing fire incidences in 12 protected forests in arid Burkina Faso. The project consisted of two components that were implemented in the villages surrounding the target forests: a campaign aimed at raising community awareness about the detrimental effects of forest fires, and a program to support establishing and maintaining forest fire prevention infrastructures. Using the synthetic control method, we find that the project resulted in an overall reduction of 35% in the number of days on which an average forest grid cell was detected to be on fire in the month of the year when fires tend to be most prevalent-November, at the very end of the agricultural season. This impact is, however, short lived (as the reduction only occurred in the November months in the first 4 years of the program), and the overall reduction in forest fire occurrences was not sufficiently large to result in a detectable increase in vegetation cover. We then try to uncover the underlying mechanisms to shed light on which of the project's components were effective to also learn how the program can be improved.",NA,NA,"webofscience","combatting forest fires in the drylands of sub-saharan africa: quasi-experimental evidence from burkina faso","paper_270"

Approaching penology as environmental history can therefore restore connections that have been severed between prison studies, political ecology, and geography. This article uses the Ushuaia penal colony/penitentiary, located in southernmost Argentina, to explore relationships between penology, inmate labor, and forestry. In the early 1900s, inmates erected the prison that would house them, and labored to provide roads, government buildings, and electricity for Ushuaia. Their main activity was felling timber, which brought together the prison and forestry departments, thus linking discipline with deforestation, and blurring the lines between the interior and exterior of the penitentiary. After decades of extensive forest fires, the lack of a self-sustaining economy, and charges of inmate abuse, the prison was closed in 1947. A subsequent campaign to salvage the region by supplanting ominous images of a natural prison with those of a beautiful landscape resulted in the establishment of a national park in 1960. And, in 1997, fifty years after its closure, the defunct prison was converted to a museum. The national park and prison museum now attract thousands of tourists annually, offering two competing - rather than co-constitutive - versions of national history. This juxtaposition of green and dark tourism is not unique to Ushuaia, and thus highlights tensions inherent to when and where sites of punishment, conservation, and memory overlap.

In September 2019, the Ivorian and Ghanaian governments imposed the Living Income Differential (LID) on private companies, an additional $ 400 per ton compared to the international market price, passed on to the producer price (farm gate price). At the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 arose. In this dual context, how did prices change? Has the hope of increased income been achieved? Three approaches are used: a) monitoring of the selling price of cocoa beans and monitoring of the price of purchased cocoa farming inputs and basic necessities for households; b) monthly monitoring of farm gate cocoa price in 2020-2021; c) an analysis of national production data from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, the world price, variations in the demand for beans by the grinding industry, and the price paid to producers, over 20 years. The first result is a very temporary and limited rise in the farm gate price of cocoa at the end of 2020, then its fall in 2021 as the price of inputs and basic necessities soar. The 2021-2022 campaign is even more harmful with a tightening of the price scissor. It is therefore the failure of the LID, but the role of Covid-19 in this failure is very nuanced with regard to the declarations of the State and the multinationals. The drop in prices and the loss of income for cocoa farmers in 2020-2022 rather fits into the economic theory of games.

Public investment in forest conservation and wildfire prevention is crucial, and public support is necessary. In this study, we explore the adequacy of two citizen engagement mechanisms to help in the prevention of wildfires. We design a preference elicitation survey to study preferences for forests and voluntary contributions towards a fire prevention programme, either through voluntary monetary contributions (crowdfunding the prevention expenses) or by contributing with time (crowdsourcing the execution of prevention tasks). We posit that individuals who value forests and forest fire prevention may be willing to contribute directly in either way. We observe that the elicited willingness to participate in either form is high and that while some individual characteristics have an impact on elicited amounts, forest-related variables have no explanatory power. Additionally, respondents who prefer time contributions contribute relatively more time than those who prefer money contributions, who in turn contribute relatively more monetarily, which suggests that using targeted mechanisms for public involvement can optimise overall contributions to forest fire prevention. Furthermore, when comparing time and monetary contributions, as well as accounting for the cost of labour in Portugal, a crowdsourcing campaign would raise more work time than would a crowdfunding campaign to cover the cost of hiring workers to perform these activities.",NA,NA,"webofscience","crowdfunding or crowdsourcing time: exploring the willingness of private citizens to help prevent forest fires","paper_325"

How paddy fields evolve under human disturbances remains poorly understood, which is critical for land use planning to compromise agricultural production and ecosystem conservation as limited land resource is available. In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of change in paddy fields were depicted and principal driving forces were explained. Mapping of paddy fields with LANDSAT satellite images reveals a constant declining trend by 14.3% in the period 1990-2015. The gross loss area is 903.3 km(2), with an annual average decreasing rate being 36.1 km(2)center dot yr(-1). The transformation matrix between paddy fields and other land uses explicitly explains the impact trajectories of multiple human activities. Specifically, 39.6% (408.1 km(2)) of the gross loss was converted to built-up lands, reflecting town translocation and human resettlement (involuntary population migration) proposed by construction of the Three Gorges Dam, as well as urbanization, industrial development and infrastructure expansion along with economic development. The area converted to forests accounts for 26.4% (238.2 km(2)), which could be ascribed to land abandonment and the reforestation campaign. 23.1% (208.7 km(2)) was converted to dry croplands by shifts in farmers' preference on crop selection following socioeconomic changes (e.g., voluntary rural population migration, land use policy adjustment, commercial farming enterprises expansion). 46.5 km(2) was converted to water bodies, indicating the effect of impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir.",NA,NA,"webofscience","decadal loss of paddy fields driven by cumulative human activities in the three gorges reservoir area, china","paper_329"

TVA's early leaders, especially David E. Lilienthal and Gordon R. Clapp, articulated a doctrine of ''grass roots democracy'' and ''decentralization'' that protected TVA from rival federal bureaucracies and provided greater flexibility and freedom in carrying out TVA's multi-purpose mission. This doctrine also led to innovations in the professionalization of TVA's highly skilled and diverse workforce. Clapp, a recognized leader in public administration, promoted employee initiative, easy access to top management, multi-disciplinary teamwork, labor/management collaboration, and partnerships with states and localities that took account of local needs and values. The development of joint cooperative councils and conferences, along with other initiatives, were visible manifestations of this ''democratic method of administration.'' In the aftermath of Clapp's chairmanship that ended in 1954, TVA placed principal emphasis on expanding its electric power system and moved to a more traditional bureaucratic structure of tight control, accountability, and discipline. The crisis of survival that developed in the 1980s had its roots in a growing isolation, rigidity, and decline of professional excellence that was an outgrowth of this new bureaucracy. The current TVA chairman, Marvin T. Runyon, is leading a recovery effort to restore TVA's competitiveness. This effort recalls the vision and values of ''grass roots democracy'' and ''decentralization'' espoused by Clapp and Lilienthal. Although coming to TVA with no prior experience in the public sector, Runyon's emphasis on customer service and satisfaction, quality products, teamwork, creative problem solving, employee empowerment, and being ''the best'' recalls the professionalism and professionalization of the public administrators who led TVA in its early years.",NA,NA,"webofscience","decentralization and initiative - tva returns to its roots","paper_333"

We conducted a spatial and temporal analysis of the Brazilian ForestCode (BFC) to understand the patterns of regulatory compliance over time and across changes in the policy, and the implications of these compliance patterns for the perceived costs to landholders and environmental performance of agricultural landscapes in the southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso. Landholdings tended to remain in compliance or not according to their status at the beginning of the study period. The perceived economic burden of BFC compliance on soya bean and beef producers (US$3-5.6 billion in net present value of the land) may in part explain the massive, successful campaign launched by the farm lobby to change the BFC. The ecological benefits of compliance (e. g. greater connectivity and carbon) with the BFC are diffuse and do not compete effectively with the economic benefits of non-compliance that are perceived by landholders. Volatile regulation of land-use decisions that affect billions in economic rent that could be captured is an inadequate forest governance instrument; effectiveness of such regulations may increase when implemented in tandem with positive incentives for forest conservation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","defending public interests in private lands: compliance, costs and potential environmental consequences of the brazilian forest code in mato grosso","paper_340"

Better public oversight and regulation of the forest commons is thus linked to democratization. Yet evidence suggests that in a number of important cases, democratization can accelerate deforestation. Using the cases of South Nandi and Karura Forests in Kenya, this article argues that to understand why requires more careful examination of how forests are incorporated into patronage networks and how these networks are impacted by democratization struggles. Specifically, this article argues that accelerated deforestation occurs when institutional configurations allow abuse and create opportunity for forests to become incorporated into patronage networks. Democratization can then exacerbate deforestation when, as in Kenya, more competitive elections produce stresses on these patronage networks and hence create incentives for state actors to increase accumulation of forest resources for political purposes. Further, the overall volatility of democratization struggles, which makes changes in government more likely, creates incentives for those with privileged access to forests to accumulate more rapidly with no concern for sustainability in the long run. However, such forest encroachments may also generate resistance and movements aimed at re-imposing regulation on the use of the forest. When successful, these struggles over forests can both deepen democratization and transform institutional configurations to better protect forests.",NA,NA,"webofscience","deforestation and democratization: patronage, politics and forests in kenya","paper_348"

The land cover classification was evaluated by the use of SPRING 5.2.3 and QGIS 2.10 (version Pisa) software, and images from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8, registered from 1985 to 2015. The basin has three main land covers: native forest, disturbed areas (mainly pasture and agriculture), and water. The results show there was proportional and inverse behavior in relation to native forest and disturbed areas. Thus, there was a reduction of the native forest and an increase in disturbed areas, from 1985 to 2005, but the opposite situation from 2005 to 2015. These results are related to the advancement of colonization in the first period, and to the actions derived from 'Save the River Bamburro' campaign in the second period, in which some areas of riparian forests were recovered.

A theory of deliberate policy disproportionality is used to analyse 20 years of regulatory reform in Queensland, focusing on the Vegetation Management Act (VMA) 1999. Application of the framework to this case suggests that political executives were prone to deliberately adopt (dis)proportionate policies as a strategic response to either manage or capitalise on stakeholder support or opposition to any proposed legislative change. The high variance in (dis)proportionate deforestation policies is attributed to how political executives respond to claims made by competing constituencies regarding the costs versus benefits of successive reforms. During key reform phases, policy under-reaction was the norm, and political executives intentionally limited the scope and effectiveness of the VMA 1999 due to perceived impacts on the agricultural sector. Political executives were highly responsive to the emotional investment of rural constituents and averse to introducing policies that required difficult trade-offs. Elections offered strategic opportunities for delivering more proportionate policies that balanced public environmental benefits with economic impacts, as evidenced by a conditional deforestation ban introduced between 2004 and 2012 and reinstated in 2018. Points for practitionersVariance in Queensland's deforestation policy over time can be attributed to the intentional decisions by political executives to limit or expand the scope of regulations as a strategic response to stakeholder expectations.Political executives were responsive to the costs versus environmental impacts/benefits of any deforestation reforms, but prone to policy under-reaction when the priority was managing the emotive reactions from rural constituencies.More proportionate regulations, such as the partial deforestation ban of 2004, aimed to balance environmental benefits with compensation for landholders but were only implemented when electorally beneficial.Stakeholders have a significant influence on disproportionate deforestation policy design and governments will need to manage competing claims to deliver more durable policy outcomes.",NA,NA,"webofscience","deliberate disproportionate policy outcomes and regulating deforestation in queensland, australia","paper_424"

In Indonesia, governments, multilateral/bilateral agencies and NGOs have applied engagement and FPIC in the development of REDD + initiatives at national and sub-national scales. This article develops a theoretical framework by adapting governmentality to deliberative democracy and then analyses how participation and engagement are used as powerful tools to govern the introduction of REDD +. The framework is applied to two sub-national REDD+ initiatives, the Central Sulawesi Pilot Province and the Kalimantan Forest and Climate Partnership. The engagement and participatory forums employed in these cases operate to alter and discipline the activities of local agents who regulate, manage and use forestry resources. They provide a political space to introduce new knowledge and external narratives on appropriate and legitimate ways to govern land-use development. As a highly managed post-political domain they enable contested issues around forests to be debated and potentially resolved, but within a prescribed managerial framework focussed on carbon mitigation. Through engagement and discursive interaction the multiple landholders, communities, businesses and government agencies are activated as subjects and citizens of these new carbon based endeavours. Those applying engagement and EPIC need to recognise the unbalanced power relations inherent within these processes; and ensure they form an integral part of a much broader and longer term deliberative exchange, rather than required steps along the trajectory of project or program delivery.",NA,NA,"webofscience","deliberative engagement and redd plus in indonesia","paper_425"

Two dominant hypotheses explain this process. First, according to the hamburger connection beef markets promote conversion of forests into cattle ranches resulting in deforestation. Second, the land-as-wealth hypothesis explains deforestation as the result of land appreciation in forest frontiers. We tested these hypotheses using land use and socioeconomic data from northwestern Amazonia from 2000 to 2009. We also investigated two key control variables: coca cultivation and eradication, both of which have been proposed as important drivers of forest loss. We found high rate of conversion from forest to pasture, and unimpeded forest fragmentation. As predicted by the hamburger connection, pastures expanded as the cattle inventory grew. Beef demand did not drive pasture expansion, as ranching revenues declined and beef prices were roughly stable. Coca cultivation did not respond to the eradication campaign, and declined as the population became increasingly urbanized. We propose that investment on roads has enhanced the anticipated value of land. Cattle bolster land claims and can be used as financial collateral, so they have inherent value even without market exchange. Cattle can then increase despite stable beef prices and declining ranching revenues. To protect biodiversity, policy interventions that enhance the value of standing forests are needed to slow deforestation and fragmentation in these rapidly changing landscapes.

We find that the original results of Buitenzorgy and Mol (2011) were spurious and inconsistent in the replication once heteroskedasticity robust standard errors were employed. When combining the two time periods and running analyses on panel data and differenced data for robust outcomes and better policy inferences, we find different results for the effect of democracy on deforestation, indicating that model specification is critical to studying this relationship. The more econometrically sound method, the differenced models, reject the Environmental Kuznet's Curve (EKC) hypothesis for democracy and deforestation, instead indicating that democracy decreased deforestation rates. When adding democracy spillover effects to the model, i.e., the impact on deforestation rates due to changes in democracy levels in neighboring countries, we still find that democracy leads to decreased rates of deforestation. We also find that having more democratic neighbors leads to further decreases in democracy. These outcomes have far-reaching implications for the blocs examined, which are highlighted in this study.",NA,NA,"webofscience","democracy and deforestation: the role of spillover effects","paper_430"

Some theorists claim that democracy reduces environmental degradation. Others argue that democracy may not reduce environmental degradation or may even harm the environment. Empirical evidence thus far has been limited and conflicting. This article seeks to address the democracy-environment debate. We focus on the effect of political regime type on human activities that directly damage the environment. Our discussion of the theoretical literature identifies different causal mechanisms through which democracy could affect environmental degradation. The empirical analysis focuses on the net effect of these competing mechanisms. We examine statistically the effect of democracy on five aspects of human-induced environmental degradation-carbon dioxide emissions, nitrogen dioxide emissions, deforestation, land degradation, and organic pollution in water. We find that democracy reduces all five types of environmental degradation. While the substantive effect of democracy is considerable, it varies in size across different types of environmental degradation. We also find nonmonotonic effects of democracy that vary across the environmental indicators.",NA,NA,"webofscience","democracy and environmental degradation","paper_432"

Theorists and policy-makers have been eager to put forward the virtues of democracy as a benign political influence on the environment, especially in contrast to the obvious environmental degradation under Communism that became obvious after its fall. Six measures of environmental protection or degradation are examined as the dependent variables, with the independent variables emerging from earlier tests of the impact of the environment on democracy. In the multiple regression analyses of three of the environmental indicators, deforestation, carbon dioxide emission, and soil erosion by water, the statistically significant effect of democracy on the environment actually was negative, contrary to prediction. In the fourth case, protected land area, the impact of democracy was positive while in the remaining two instances, freshwater availability and soil erosion by chemicals, there was no significant effect of democracy on the environment. Other variables such as economic development, agricultural density, European location, age of the polity, and precipitation behaved empirically as one would intuitively expect. These findings suggest that democracy cannot be viewed unidimensionally in its relationship to the environment, and that assumptions by theorists and policy-makers concerning the positive effect of democracy on the environment need to be re-examined.",NA,NA,"webofscience","democracy and the environment: an empirical assessment","paper_436"

Very prominent among the myriad factors at play is the political environment within these tropical countries. This study therefore investigates to what extent the rate of tropical deforestation is exacerbated by the democratic/non-democratic nature of the governments in power. We construct a democracy index variable for fifty-five countries across the four regions of the tropical world. The average annual deforestation from 1981-85, is compared to the democracy index variable. We find a strong negative correlation between the level of democracy and the rate of tropical forest exploitation. The global policy implications of this finding are outlined.

When the relative forest area change weighted with forest area in the country was plotted against the level of democracy in 121-131 less-developed countries the slopes of fitted linear regressions were statistically significant for all three democracy indices, linking positive forest area change and non-democracy.

Protection of forested areas provides long-term public goods, while their destruction provides short-term private goods for particular voters. Politicians facing a competitive election offer voters access to forested areas mainly for small-scale farming or commercial use of timber in exchange for electoral support. I test this theory of political deforestation using satellite generated global forest cover data and the results of over 1,000 national-level elections between 1982 and 2016. I find that countries that undergo a democratic transition lose an additional 0.8 percentage points of their forest cover each year, that years with close elections have over 1 percentage point per year higher forest cover loss compared to nonelection years, and that as the margin of victory in an election decreases by 10 points, the amount of deforestation increases by 0.7 percentage points per year. These increases are on the order of 5-10 times the average rate of forest loss globally. This suggests democratization is associated with underprovision of environmental public goods and contested elections are partially responsible for this underprovision.",NA,NA,"webofscience","democratization, elections, and public goods: the evidence from deforestation","paper_453"

Neither of these approaches is felt to produce information that is reliable in terms of describing the conditions that exist in natural fires. In this paper, we present the results of the study of two fires located in the boreal forest of interior Alaska, one during the summer of 1990 and the second during the summer of 1994. In this study, we utilized remote sensing imagery for two purposes. First, pre-fire imagery was used to map the distribution of vegetation/forest cover prior to the fire. A field-sampling campaign was then conducted to estimate the levels of above and below-ground biomass levels associated with each vegetation/forest category. Second, approaches were developed to use satellite imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper to estimate three levels of fire severity in the burned forests. Ground data were again collected to estimate the percentage of biomass consumed during fires in each of these classes. By combining the two sets of information, it was possible to estimate the amounts of carbon-based greenhouse gases released during each fire. In the two fires, 25 and 38 t C ha(-1) were released, values which are two to three times greater than previously estimated for boreal forest ecosystems. These studies show that most (85%) of the carbon released originates from the burning of biomass in the ground layer (e.g., mosses, litter, and organic soil), which contrasts greatly with biomass burning in other biomes, where almost all the biomass consumed is in above-ground vegetation. To estimate the different species of gases released, we developed a fire behaviour model to divide the fires into two classes: flaming and smouldering. We then used published values to estimate the amount of different greenhouses released during these two fire phases. In a relative sense, much lower levels of carbon dioxide and higher levels of methane and carbon monoxide are released during naming fires in boreal forests because smouldering fires are responsible for burning ground-layer organic matter.",NA,NA,"webofscience","direct effects of fire on the boreal forest carbon budget","paper_477"

However, others argue that democracy leads to environmental degradation. We revisit this contentious relationship between regime type and environment degradation in the context of deforestation. Using panel data on 139 countries during the 1990-2012 period, we find that democracy is associated with lower levels of forest coverage. Although our results appear counter-intuitive, further analyses reveal the positive effect of democracy on forest area coverage is conditional upon the level of economic development. Roughly, at per capita income of about US$8200, the impact of democracy on forest coverage becomes positive. Our results suggest that a democratic government's priority to tackle environmental problems depends on its level of economic development.

Second, countries in democratic transition experience the highest deforestation rates, compared to non-democracies and mature democracies.

On the other hand, research is also concerned with how deforestation drives people out of rural areas, leading to overurbanization. From this work, it is clear that the movement of people has an important relationship to forest loss, but it is less clear what the autonomy of people is in this process. Put differently, more focus has been put on state-level economic and environmental factors than political factors when considering the impact of domestic migration on forest loss. Although there has been substantial work on how political factors, like democracy, impact forest loss, there is less research on how political rights, like freedom of domestic movement, may impact forest loss. To build on this research, we test the impact of freedom of domestic movement and democracy on forest loss from 2001 to 2014 for a sample of 107 low- and middle-income nations. We find support for the idea that having more freedom of movement decreases forest loss in more democratic nations compared to less democratic nations. We also find that both rural and urban population growth, among others, is associated with higher levels of forest loss.

However, the effectiveness of the afforestation programs and its impacts on vegetation cover and hydrology has not been well studied. This study aims to assess the recent campaigned afforestation program and its impact on vegetation cover and hydrology in the upper Awash basin, Ethiopia. Landsat 8 images of 2013-2020 years were used to calculate the NDVI for the upper Awash basin to assess trends in vegetation greenness for the basin. Moreover, observed streamflow and precipitation datasets of the basin were collected and used for assessing the impact of the afforestation on hydrology. The study result showed decreasing NDVI values despite the afforestation programs in the upper Awash basin. This shows either afforestation rate was less than the deforestation rate or the tree plantation campaign was not effective in the basin. In addition, the campaign based tree plantation focused on the number of tree planted not on how many trees are grown. On the other hand, mean annual precipitation and streamflow were generally increased from 2013 to 2020 in the upper Awash basin. Declining NDVI values but increasing mean annual precipitation in the Awash basin indicated that the declining vegetation was attributed to anthropogenic effects. The increasing streamflow during the same time could be due to the increasing mean annual precipitation. Moreover, the decreasing vegetation cover might have contributed for the increasing streamflow through increasing surface runoff and decreasing transpiration. How-ever, further research is required to assess the precise impacts of afforestation on vegetation cover and hydrologic processes. Generally, the study result showed that the focus of afforestation should be on tree growing than on tree plantation alone.",NA,NA,"webofscience","does the recent afforestation program in ethiopia influenced vegetation cover and hydrology? a case study in the upper awash basin, ethiopia","paper_496"

Recent studies have shown that soil Hg loss occurs rapidly after deforestation, suggesting that Hg mobility could be related to the massive cation input resulting from biomass burning. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of the first year of slash-and-bum agriculture on soil Hg levels at the regional scale of the Tapajos River, in the state of Para, Brazilian Amazon. A total of 429 soil samples were collected in 26 farms of five riparian communities of the Tapajos basin. In September 2004, soil samples were collected from primary forest sites planned for slash-and-bum cultivation. In August 2005, one year after the initial burning, a second campaign was held and the exact same sites were re-sampled. Our results showed that total Hg levels in soils did not change significantly during the first year following slash-and-bum, suggesting no immediate release of soil Hg at that point in time. However, an early Hg mobility was detected near the surface (0-5 cm), reflected by a significant shift in Hg distribution in soil fractions. Indeed, a transfer of Hg from fine to coarser soil particles was observed, indicating that chemical bonds between Hg and fine particles could have been altered. A correspondence analysis (CA) showed that this process could be linked to a chemical competition caused by cation enrichment The regional dimension of the study highlighted the prevailing importance of soil types in Hg dynamics, as shown by differentiated soil responses following deforestation according to soil texture. Confirming an early Hg mobility and indicating an eventual Hg release out of the soil, our results reinforce the call for the development of more sustainable agricultural practices in the Amazon.

The environmental consequences of forest land conversion have concerned the indigenous people living downstream, and this was the first motivation for the Y Ikatu Xingu campaign-'save the good water of the Xingu'. Among the objectives of the initiative was to restore riparian forests on private land across the basin. For a region where the rivers, rainstorms, forest remnants, distances and farms are huge, the challenges were equally large: crossing the biotic and abiotic thresholds of degradation, as well as addressing the lack of technology, know-how, seeds, forest nurseries, trained personnel and roads, and the lack of motivation for restoration. After 6 years, despite the remarkable advances in terms of technical innovation coupled with a broad and effective social involvement, the restored areas represent only a small portion of those aimed for. The still high costs of restoration, the uncertainties of legislation and also the global economy have been strong forces constraining the expansion of restored forests. Additional efforts and strategies are necessary to overcome these barriers.",NA,NA,"webofscience","ecological restoration of xingu basin headwaters: motivations, engagement, challenges and perspectives","paper_516"

However, there has been no cross-national research that examines if forestry export flows from poor to rich nations is associated with higher rates of deforestation in poor nations. As such, we seek to address this gap in the literature by constructing cross-national regression models of forest loss from 1990 to 2005 for a sample of 60 poor nations. In doing so, we find substantial support for ecologically unequal exchange theory that poor nations with higher levels of forestry export flows to rich nations tend to have higher rates of deforestation. We also find that a number of other factors are related to deforestation. These include international nongovernmental organizations, democracy, total forestry production, total population growth, rural population growth, and tropical climate. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, theoretical implications, methodological implications, policy suggestions, and possible directions for future research.",NA,NA,"webofscience","ecologically unequal exchange and deforestation:a cross-national analysis of forestry export flows","paper_518"

In Northeastern China, summer (June to August) streamflow accounts for about 50% of total annual streamflow and is vital to water supply and management in the region. Understanding how forest recovery may affect streamflow is important to both reforestation campaign and long-term water sustainability. In this study, we analysed 33 years of summer hydrologic data (1970-2002) from two comparable small-scale watersheds located in the Xiaoxing'anling, Northeastern China. Time series analysis and two graphic methods (double mass curve and flow duration curve) with statistical testing as well as long-term data on forest cover changes and climate were used. Our results show that the significant streamflow reduction as a result of reforestation occurred when forest cover reached 70% or 10 years after planting. After forest cover reached 85%, water reduction became stabilized. The accumulative streamflow reduction in 2002 reached 8.61% of the total accumulative streamflow. Among those water reduced, high flows (from 5 to 25 percentiles) were mostly affected, demonstrating that northeastern forests have an important role in reducing high flows. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of climate change, reforestation and water resource management.

This work takes advantage of a nationwide titling campaign in Panama to explore the effect of private titling on forest cover across a heterogeneous landscape covering all stages of forest transition and diverse tenure arrangements. Situated in a broader matched analysis of the influence of zoning and tenure on forest cover, private management is estimated to have contributed to the deforestation of 1750-3650 km2 of mature forest nationwide from 1990 to 2020 with an average marginal effect of 15.3%. Conversely, Protected Areas and Indigenous Comarcas are estimated to have protected 1700-3900 km2 and 500-1250 km2 of mature forest, respectively. Private titling is associated with increased deforestation both during titling and years after, supporting observations that the titling process itself encourages speculative deforestation by title seekers and that private landholders value natural forests less than other land uses such as cattle. By disaggregating the data by region to highlight different stages of forest transition as well as by processes of deforestation and forest growth, this analysis shows that while private titling accelerates deforestation, it also encourages investment in reforestation. This presents a paradox for private titles and forests where agencies may perversely encourage speculative deforestation by creating stronger markets for forest-ready landscapes than for intact natural forests. In cases such as this one, where deforestation helps to secure a title, this paradox is confounded when having a title is set as a precondition for participation in a forest conservation program.",NA,NA,"webofscience","effect of land tenure on forest cover and the paradox of private titling in panama","paper_537"

Across 2253 municipalities, those with higher deforestation see a significant rise in deforestation during federal-and-state election years. Municipal election years raise deforestation for locations with lower deforestation, whereas all of these increases are accentuated when there is party alignment between different levels of government.

Deforestation predictions using those widely applied drivers can underestimate deforestation rates by as much as 50%. We show that years with the highest deforestation rates also correlate with large administrative shifts caused by presidential elections which results in periods of managerial instability associated with episodic inefficiency, leading to weak institutions unable to properly combat illegal deforestation. Although surveillance and regulatory action plans to combat deforestation have held back deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2005, our results suggest that environmental management institutions should be aware such administration shifts set a burden on the policy targets associated with conservation policies. Institutional vulnerability immediately after major elections is an acknowledged fact in Brazil, though it has been mostly disregarded as an indicator of ecological threat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we assessed the runoff generation, flow paths and water source dynamics of a pristine rainforest catchment in Costa Rica using end member mixing analysis (EMMA) and a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR). Geochemical tracer data collected over a 4-week field campaign were combined with tritium data used to assess potential deeper groundwater flow pathways to the perennial stream. The streamflow composition was best captured using three end-members, namely throughfall, shallow (5-15 cm) and deeper (15-50 cm) soil water. We estimated the end-member contributions to the main stream and two tributaries using the two mixing approaches and found good agreement between results obtained from EMMA and MixSIAR. The system was overwhelmingly dominated by near-surface sources, with little evidence for deeper and older groundwater as tritium-derived baseflow mean transit time was between 2.0 and 4.4 years. The shallow soil flow pathway dominated streamflow contributions in the main stream (median 39% and 49% based on EMMA and MixSIAR, respectively), followed by the deeper soil (32% and 31%) and throughfall (25% and 19%). The two tributaries had even greater shallow soil water contributions relative to the main stream (83% and 74% for tributary A and 42% and 63% for tributary B). Tributary B had no detectable deep soil water contribution, reflecting the morphology of the hillslope (steeper slopes, shallower soils and lower vegetation density compared to hillslope A). Despite the short sampling campaign and associated uncertainties, this study allowed to thoroughly assess runoff generation mechanisms in a humid tropical catchment. Our results also provide a first comparison of two increasingly used mixing models and suggest that EMMA and MixSIAR yield comparable estimates of water source partitioning in this tropical, volcanic rainforest environment.",NA,NA,"webofscience","end member and bayesian mixing models consistently indicate near-surface flowpath dominance in a pristine humid tropical rainforest","paper_556"

Specifically, the paper focuses on the effect of energy justice and democratization. The main contribution to the literature hinges on the emphasis on energy justice - operationalized as rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking - and its interaction with democracy. Using a panel data of 47 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2000-2020 and the dynamic two-step generalized method of moment estimator, the results generally indicate that improvement in rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking is associated with a reduction in deforestation. Democracy is similarly found to be associated with reduction in deforestation. The conditional effect analysis largely depicts an intensified reducing effect of energy justice on deforestation in the presence of improved democratic practices. The results though robust to an alternative estimator, the Driscoll-Kraay estimator, differ when sub-regional analysis is considered. The paper aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 7, 13, 15 and 16.",NA,NA,"webofscience","energy justice, democracy and deforestation","paper_559"

This controversy was sparked by a campaign promoting the legalisation and management of these hitherto informal forests and promising multiple socioeconomic and ecological benefits by developing what we call new forests. Emphasising dormant potential and claiming win-win solutions meant a fundamental discursive shift away from abandoned farmland's negative framing. We conducted a political discourse analysis of media coverage, campaigns, and legislation around new forests from 2013 through 2022. Our approach draws on an analysis of practical argumentation and a Science and Technology Studies (STS)-inspired issue-oriented perspective. We found that the controversy on the future use of this land was one of conflicting visions rather than actual land-use conflicts. Three camps developed, advocating private new forests, state-controlled forestry, and agricultural recultivation. We discuss how the new forest controversy reflects broader rationalities, and tensions between agriculture, forestry, carbon sequestration, and forest conservation that remain relevant even though circumstances for policies of farmland reuse in Russia have changed fundamentally since 2022.",NA,NA,"webofscience","envisioning new forests on abandoned farmland in russia: a discourse analysis of a controversy","paper_584"

Understanding forest structure proves vital in accurately estimating both forest biomass and also the natural disturbances and remote sensing is an essential method for quantification of forest properties and structure in the tropics. Our objective is to examine canopy vegetation profiles formulated from discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) data and examine their usefulness in estimating forest structural parameters measured during a field campaign. We developed a modeling procedure that utilized hypothetical stand characteristics to examine lidar profiles. In essence, this is a simple method to further enhance shape characteristics from the lidar profile. In this paper we report the results comparing field data collected at La Selva, Costa Rica (10 degrees 26' N, 83 degrees 59' W) and forest structure and parameters calculated from vegetation height profiles and forest structural modeling. We developed multiple regression models for each measured forest biometric property using forward stepwise variable selection that used Bayesian information criteria (BIC) as selection criteria. Among measures of forest structure, ranging from tree lateral density, diameter at breast height, and crown geometry, we found strong relationships with lidar canopy vegetation profile parameters. Metrics developed from lidar that were indicators of height of canopy were not significant in estimating plot biomass (p-value = 0.31, r(2) = 0.17), but parameters from our synthetic forest model were found to be significant for estimating many of the forest structural properties, such as mean trunk diameter (p-value = 0.004, r(2) = 0.51) and tree density (p-value = 0.002, r(2) = 0.43). We were also able to develop a significant model relating lidar profiles to basal area (p-value = 0.003, r(2) = 0.43). Use of the full lidar profile provided additional avenues for the prediction of field based forest measure parameters. Our synthetic canopy model provides a novel method for examining lidar metrics by developing a look-up table of profiles that determine profile shape, depth, and height. We suggest that the use of metrics indicating canopy height derived from lidar are limited in understanding biomass in a forest with little variation across the landscape and that there are many parameters that may be gleaned by lidar data that inform on forest biometric properties.

The essay deploys Robyn Wiegman's notion of liberal whiteness to argue that liberal white subjectivity is cultivated in these texts by its self-conscious distancing, or disaffiliation, from colonial spatial practices. It is argued that this distancing is achieved through the active inclusion of First Nations peoples in the texts such that the boreal forest is constructed as a socio-natural working landscape. Liberal white disaffiliation is explored through three specific tropes: inclusion, inverted racial historicism and economic partnership.",NA,NA,"webofscience","ethnoscaping canada's boreal forest: liberal whiteness and its disaffiliation from colonial space","paper_600"

The aim of this study was to identify the most important policy instruments for supporting climate change mitigation efforts in the land-use sector in Finland and increase understanding on the performance of these instruments. This was done by analysing experts' views on the most effective policy instruments related to climate change mitigation in agricultural and urban land use in Finland and identifying the criteria that experts use when evaluating these instruments. The experts' views were obtained by interviews, a workshop and a survey, and the results were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. The experts emphasized the effectiveness of economic policy instruments in the promotion of practical measures for climate change mitigation. According to the experts, the most effective policy instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the land use sector would be a fee for deforestation. However, based on the analyses using four other evaluation criteria (efficiency, legality, democracy, legitimacy), economic policy instruments imply greater challenges than regulatory or informational policy instruments. Furthermore, based on the results, the coherence of economic policy instruments, i.e. to what extent they have synergies in achieving different policy objectives, needs to be carefully examined in the planning phase. In particular, more attention should be paid to the analysis of relationship across different scales of governance when designing new policy instruments for climate change mitigation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","evaluation of policy instruments for supporting greenhouse gas mitigation efforts in agricultural and urban land use","paper_609"

This article offers an exemplary case of this debate, exploring the theoretical links between democracy and environmental protection advanced by Walker (1999): accountability, development and participation. The site of the study is a Mexican native village, one of many incorporated into the metropolis, Mexico City. The city is faced with the challenge to supply an expanding population of some 20 million with housing, clean water and oxygen. The forest in the common property belonging to the original inhabitants is formally protected with logging bans and a rigorous Land Use Plan, yet illegal sales of this communal land to new settlers result in irregular settlements which now contain one quarter of the village's inhabitants. In 1997 local elections were reinstated in Mexico City, after a suspension of nearly 70 years. Although the governing party in the city promoted the protective Land Use Plan, the party's local politicians promised to regularize the zone in exchange for votes from the irregular settlers. These dynamics are explored in the context of everyday political practices in the village. The struggles over material and symbolic resources are analyzed in terms of force fields with multiple actors, making visible the ways in which democratic elections alone cannot prevent the ongoing deforestation caused by irregular settlements.

However, despite several theoretical explorations on the nexus, a dearth of empirical literature on the poverty-environmental degradation nexus, specifically on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), still exists. In this study, we investigated the poverty-environmental degradation nexus in SSA. We hypothesized that poverty is both a cause and effect of environmental degradation, and this relationship is explained as a vicious cycle. Unlike previous studies, we employed several alternative indicators of environmental degradation to examine the poverty-environmental degradation nexus in this study. We used data from 41 countries of SSA between 1996 and 2019 and employed the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. The findings suggest a cyclical relationship between poverty and environmental degradation in SSA, which confirms that an increase in poverty leads to an increase in environmental degradation, especially in deforestation and PM2.5 emissions. Similarly, the increase in environmental degradation positively affects poverty in SSA. We also confirmed that exogenous conditioning factors such as population growth rate, education, industrialization, and income inequality, institutional quality indicators such as governance effectiveness, control of corruption, freedom ad civil liberty, and democracy, and endogenous factors including fossil fuel energy use, fuelwood energy use, household health expenditure, infant mortality rate, and agriculture productivity influence the nexus between poverty and environmental degradation. The findings on the relationship between poverty and environmental degradation in SSA are a testimonial evidence that both poverty and environmental degradation are significant issues in SSA. Hence, poverty alleviation policies in SSA should not lead to PM2.5 emissions and deforestation, which may as well force people into a poverty-environmental degradation trap. Instead, poverty reduction policies should simultaneously achieve environmental conservation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","examination of the poverty-environmental degradation nexus in sub-saharan africa","paper_617"

Polarimetric interferometric synthetic aperture radar L-band-2 (PiSAR-L2) is a second-generation airborne sensor developed by JAXA. We acquired full-polarimetric data at a fine spatial resolution of 2.5 m during the PiSAR-L2 flight campaign in August 2012. A total of 59 field measurement plots for aboveground forest carbon stocks (AFCSs) were established in same year where AFCS ranged between 4.8 and 253.5 Mg C ha(-1). The plots comprised natural and plantation forests. These plot-level field data were used for calibrating and validating AFCS estimation models with the SAR data. Various possibilities including direct sigma naught backscatters and their ratios and various types of textures obtained from HH, HV, and VV polarizations were examined by applying regression modeling. The main indicators used for the selection of best potential models in the calibration phase were R-2, variable inflation factor (VIF), p-value, and root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs). The potential models were validated using the leave-one-out (LOO) method. The results indicated that a simple combination of backscatters and their ratios provides an AFCS estimate with an RMSE of 42.37 Mg C ha(-1) and an R-2 of 0.65. Inclusion of SAR textural parameters improved the AFCS estimates with an RMSE of 30.93 Mg C ha(-1) and an R-2 of 0.80. This indicates that the airborne PiSAR-L2 full-polarimetric data have the potential to estimate forest carbon stocks with an improved accuracy in the tropical region.",NA,NA,"webofscience","examining high-resolution pisar-l2 textures for estimating tropical forest carbon stocks","paper_619"

To generate recommendations for expanding Mongolia's protected areas system, we relied upon a clear set of priorities, an interdisciplinary approach, multiple methods, and extensive fieldwork and contact with local people, and we backed up establishment with capacity-building through training. Our objective was to encompass representatives of the nation's major ecological zones and protect the greatest number of species possible. Expansion becomes increasingly difficult once the least controversial sites have received protection, but if Mongolia hopes to achieve its goal of protecting 30% of its territory, it must create additional protected areas, expand existing reserves, increase the types of possible protected areas, and create habitat corridors and buffer zones.

It was found that most household of the samples were male. The average age was 48 years old. Almost all of them were immigrants and had graduated from primary school. The main career was growing crops. Factors affecting community's participation in forest conservation activities were gender, education, benefit from forest use and the villager's attitude towards their leader with statistical significance level at 0.05. Problems and obstacles were caused by both villagers (e.g., they could not give all their best in forest conservation because they had to struggle for food and shelters), and government agencies (e.g., they were not sincere in helping villagers prolong their conservation campaign). To conserve forest resources in Moo Ban Klongsai, government organizations should reconsider their previous performances and enhance local people's awareness in forest resource conservation and supporting more cooperation between government organizations and local community and connecting other government sectors. It could be expected that to reach enduring forest conservation, government sectors should provide local people long term occupations, health services and infrastructure to ensure that they will not illegally encroach forest resources in the future.",NA,NA,"webofscience","factor affecting community's participation in forest resource conservation : klongsai village, wang nam khiao sub-district, wang nam khiao district, nakhon ratchasima province","paper_630"

To protect local people, UN-REDD has developed social safeguards including a commitment to strengthen local democracy to prevent an elite capture of REDD+ benefits. This study examines local participation and representation in the UN-REDD international policy board and in the national-level design process for the Nigeria-REDD proposal, to see if practices are congruent with the UN-REDD commitment to local democracy. It is based on research in Nigeria in 2012 and 2013, and finds that local representation in the UN-REDD policy board and in Nigeria-REDD is not substantive. Participation is merely symbolic. For example, elected local government authorities, who ostensibly represent rural people, are neither present in the UN-REDD board nor were they invited to the participatory forums that vetted the Nigeria-REDD. They were excluded because they were politically weak. However, UN-REDD approved the Nigeria-REDD proposal without a strategy to include or strengthen elected local governments.

They are a major cause of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Their multiple sources are most diverse and root in nature and society. The immediate fire effects directly and the long-term landscape ecosystem degradations indirectly cause major and persisting and serious problems of public health and ecosystem service. Smoke haze from the forest and land fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2015 caused significant environmental and economic losses in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. We describe the different types of land uses and land cover where fires and smoke haze took place, and how local politics have affected fire use from 2001 to 2017. We calculated hot spots from satellite imageries as proxies for fire occurrences and applied regression analysis to understand the link between fire and local politics in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The results show that the greatest frequency of hot spots occurred in wood and oil palm plantations and logging concessions (47%), followed by conservation areas (31%) and community land (22%). Local elections involve land transactions, and fires were used as a cheap way to increase the land value. The use of fire as means of land clearing was strongly influenced by local politics. Their frequency and abundance obviously increased about a year prior to local elections. The reasons behind the correlation need to be understood so that appropriate incentives and sanctions can be put in place and deter political leaders from using fire as an incentive to their advantage.",NA,NA,"webofscience","forest and land fires, toxic haze and local politics in indonesia","paper_648"

Sustainable development in a forest bioeconomy is a system geared towards improving people's socioeconomic and environmental situation through forestry, yet in Ghana, it is neither heard about nor well understood by many people. A good knowledge about the forest bioeconomic system will enhance people to become custodians of the forest ecosystems instead of being destroyers. Field and secondary data were collected and analyzed using IBM SPSS 29.0, CANOCO 5.0, and ArcGIS 10.5. The study showed that larger areas of forest were found in decade 1 (1990-1999) relative to decade 2 (2000-2009) and decade 3 (2010-2020). Forests' contributions to GDP vary between the forest-vegetation belts and regions, decreasing rapidly from 1990 to 2020. Population growth, agricultural activities, and commodity-driven deforestation ranked highest in the list of the drivers of deforestation. A reduction in deforestation might bring about a reduction in carbon emissions; however, the economic repercussions are negative as the contribution of forest to GDP, income, and employment will fall as trade-offs. Findings from the study will significantly help to bring lasting solutions to deforestation and enhance the sustainable forest bioeconomy. The study has unveiled remote drivers of forest loss that have been long overlooked by previous studies. A sustainable enlightenment campaign and routine informal education of the rural people are highly necessary. This is because some of the peoples' reasons for deforestation and preference for forest products compared with modern resources seem convincing and logical.",NA,NA,"webofscience","forest bioeconomy in ghana: understanding the potential indicators for its sustainable development","paper_649"

The study tests the hypothesis that forest land is being converted to the selected land use categories with high growth tendency and controlling deforestation rate to its half of the present level would significantly improve the land cover under forest. The rate of forest land conversion to other land use categories is analyzed and then compared with the total area expanded under three land use classes. We used Systems dynamic modeling approach to estimate forest area by simulating forest land conversion in Pakistan, projecting to 2030. The results show that rangeland, built-up area and cultivated land have increased over time; growth rate of built-up area (9%) is highest followed by rangeland area (1.7%) and cultivated area (0.3%), respectively; rangeland is the dominant category in terms of area expanded (0.74 m. ha). Sensitivity analysis showed that reducing deforestation rate to half of the past level of 1% could not significantly improve forest area; therefore, it is suggested that controlling deforestation alone is not an effective strategy unless drastic measures, e.g., demarcation of forest boundaries, land use control policy and afforestation campaign would be started in the country.",NA,NA,"webofscience","forest land conversion dynamics: a case of pakistan","paper_673"

The parameters for the main pan-tropical allometric equations are tree height and diameter and specific timber density, but none of the trees measured are from African forests. The few equations established for Africa turn out to be insufficient, in particular because large trees are not sufficiently represented in the samples measured. To address this data deficit, we measured 55 trees with a diameter of 10 to 120 cm, from 23 different species in a dense semi-deciduous forest in south-eastern Cameroon. After felling, the logs were cross-cut and measured until the one centimetre in diameter cutting. The sample was used to link the diameter and total timber volume of the trees via polynomial non-linear models (addition and multiplication). Then tree biomass should be deduced by applying the specific density and a correction factor for foliage. In order to refine these measurements, the sample will be enlarged during a further measurement campaign to produce a closer estimation of the total volume of huge trees.",NA,NA,"webofscience","formulating an equation for cameroon timber between tree diameter and the total timber volume of trees","paper_696"

This article analyses climate change plans and programs for the coffee sector considering the coffee rust epidemic, a disease caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix which has generated important losses to coffee production since the 2012/2013 cycle. Structural problems created ideal conditions for this disease which has been associated with climate change, whilst the institutional response has generated new challenges for coffee producing communities who live in biodiversity hotspots like the Chiapas Sierra Madre in southern Mexico. We discuss the synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation by analyzing the campaign in favor of carbon stocks and biodiversity in shade-grown coffee plantations of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Designed in response to the current coffee rust epidemic, this campaign emphasizes deforestation, forest degradation and loss of ecosystem services that is associated with the current crisis of shade-grown coffee, with proposals set out to benefit both ecosystems and the coffee communities.

They also play a vital role in evaluating forest carbon pools. This study presents a Matern kernel-based Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach for biomass estimation integrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter intensities with LiDAR measurements. We use the backscatter intensities from five scenes of L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) simulated NISAR data collected during the 2019 AM-PM NASA airborne campaign. The biomass map derived from LVIS (Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor) Lidar point clouds over the Lenoir landing site, Alabama, was used with these simulated NISAR data. We have utilized the GPR model to estimate the AGB of the entire forest alongside the major forest classes in the study area, namely deciduous, evergreen, and woody wetlands. To examine the dependency of the model on acquisition conditions, we calibrated and validated our proposed model utilizing scene combinations. The experiment shows that multiple-scene retrieval delivered improved AGB estimates compared to single-scene retrieval. We evaluated the efficacy of the GPR model for three AGB ranges, i.e., (i) 8 to 100 Mg ha-1, (ii) 8 to 230 Mg ha-1, and (iii) 8 to 470 Mg ha-1 at 20 m, 30 m, 50 m and 100 m spatial resolution, respectively. The results indicate that the RMSE incurred by the GPR model for all these AGB ranges seemed to reduce as we increased spatial extent or reduced spatial resolution from 20 m to 100 m. Further, we demonstrate the performance of the optimized GPR model to retrieve AGB within the biomass range of 8 Mg ha-1 to 100 Mg ha-1 for all the above-mentioned forest types. Finally, this research highlights the advantages of the Matern kernel-based GPR model over other statistical regression models towards improved AGB mapping.",NA,NA,"webofscience","gaussian process regression-based forest above ground biomass retrieval from simulated l-band nisar data","paper_714"

The study was participated by the indigenous Tagbanua bird poachers in the area. Preliminary information was obtained using key informant interview and focused group discussion. Appropriate parabiology training was conducted to equip the participants with practical skills needed in the data gathering. The study unfolded that there were only two species of birds commonly poached in the watershed, the Tanygnathus lucionensis and Gracula religiosa. These birds nest only on four species of trees which typically towers above the canopy layer. Remarkably, more than 60% of the recorded nesting trees belong to a single species of tree, the Koompassia excelsa. The GIS analysis unveiled that most nesting trees were located in the interior part of the forest. The skill needed to venture into the jungle highlights the role of Tagbanua Tribesmen in the poaching activity in the area.

The panel specifically focuses on desertification, deforestation, and climate change as urgent global environmental threats possibly requiring Security Council action because of their potential to cause massive loss of life and undermine state functions. The report provokes important questions: If for example, a nation embarked upon a massive deforestation campaign which upset the ocean currents and threatened to send an entire continent into a deep freeze, would the Security Council be able to take measures against the offending nation to counteract this massive environmental threat? In this Note, Alexandra Knight argues that it is legally justified and legitimate for the Security Council, acting tinder the provisions of Chapter VII, Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, to impose measures to counter regional or global threats to the environment which pose a grave threat to human life and living conditions. While Chapter VII measures also include the use of force, Knight argues that only Article 41 measures-non-military measures like sanctions or interruption of communications-are appropriate to counter environmental threats.",NA,NA,"webofscience","global environmental threats: can the security council protect our earth?","paper_727"

A negative campaign blaming illegal coffee producers for the loss of tigers in the Bukit Barisan Selatan (BBS) National Park in the province further complicates the issue, as the current coffee supply chain could not guarantee the workability of price transparency and asymmetric structures of coffee markets, to name a few. In this region, community initiatives have been developed to foster forest conservation by adopting coffee multi-strata practices under the agroforestry system and community-based forestry management in the buffer zone outside the BBS National Park. Based on research findings, buyer-driven regulation of environmental practices in the coffee industry, which characterize most global initiatives, have somehow restructured the supply chain in producing regions. Recent global sustainability standards require adequate organizational capacity of coffeefarmer groups and rural cooperatives involved in the supply chain. The paper recommends policy integration between bottom-up initiatives at farm level or institutional changes at supply-chain organizations, and top-down sustainability standards set by the private sector and non-government organizations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","global sustainability regulation and coffee supply chains in lampung province, indonesia","paper_730"

Believing that they could persuade loggers to use less predatory practices, the mainstream NGOs developed a certification scheme in association with timber companies known as the FSC - Forest Stewardship Council. Since then, the NGOs have gained influence over international policies.

There is a multitude of empirical studies examining this relationship using various measures of governance and study designs, coming to diverse conclusions. In order to identify the source of variation across studies, this article conducts a meta-analysis of 32 empirical cross-country studies in the field of economics, containing 227 estimates of the impact of different governance measures on deforestation. Using an ordered probit model, we find that the choice of the governance measure is the main factor in explaining variations in the outcomes of the studies. In particular, studies using environmental policy, ownership rights, presence of environmental NGOs, and rule of law as measures of governance, are more likely to find that better governance reduces deforestation. In contrast, studies using democracy and rights as a measure of governance are more likely to find that deforestation increases, when governance is improved. The finding that not all aspects of governance improvements are equally supportive of forest conservation suggests that more nuanced analyses of specific aspects of environmental governance are required to guide evidence based policy making.",NA,NA,"webofscience","governance and deforestation - a meta-analysis in economics","paper_737"

Using in situ data from a 2008-2009 forest inventory field campaign, in Sri Lanka, this study describes the structural characteristics and carbon stocks of six natural forest types. This paper has a dual scope: i) to highlight the variation in carbon stored in aboveground biomass within and between forest types and ii) to determine the implications of the allometric equations chosen to calculate biomass carbon stocks. This study concerns work related to climate change interventions, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and other forest-related, performance-based initiatives that require proper monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon stocks, sinks and emissions. The results revealed that forests are heterogeneous in terms of tree density and height-diameter relationships, both between and within the six forest types investigated. The mean aboveground carbon stock in the different forest types ranged from 22 to 181 Mg C ha(-1), and there were statistically significant differences in the carbon stocks of the six forest types in 7 of 15 cases. The estimated carbon stock depended heavily on the allometric equation used for the calculations, the variables, and its application to the specific life zone. Due to the diversity of forest structures, these results suggest that caution should be taken when applying default values to estimate forest carbon stocks and emission values in reporting and accounting schemes. The results also indicated the need for allometric equations that are context-specific for different forest types. Therefore, new field investigations and measurements are needed to determine these specific allometric equations, as well as the potential variation in forest carbon stocks in tropical natural forests.

Deforestation and reclamation of cultivable waste land in the arable lowlands, for the purpose of resettlement through processes of land grants, installing feudal institutions to collect revenues and cover territorial administration and various policy incentives to attract hill people and Indian immigrants to expand settlements and agricultural expanse, all represent the historical processes of land cover change until 1950. The end of the Rana regime, through establishment of democracy, brought reforms in land tenure and abolished anti-peasantry feelings, which consequently attracted hill people to settle in the lowlands of Tarai, Bhawar, and Duns. Following from the eradication of malaria in the 1950s and 1960s, planned resettlement programs and the implementation of development projects attracted people from food-deficit conditions in the hills to the lowlands, causing a large-scale change in the land cover as well as the cultural landscape. Time series land cover maps revealed the predominance of forest in all physiographic units except Tarai in 1954. Forest cover began to decline in the later decades in all physiographic units at the gain of cultivated land. Forest coverage in the hill slopes, inner river valleys, and Duns and Bhawar represented 92, 72, 48, and 79% of the total area in 1954, which reduced to 89, 43, 36, and 64% in 1979. Forest cover in Tarai reduced from 30 to 15% by 1979 over the same period. It further reduced to 85, 24, 29, and 58% respectively in 1994. Only 10% of the area in Tarai was under forest. Compared to 1994, forest coverage decreased to 82, 20, 28, and 54% in the hill slopes, inner river valleys, and Duns and Bhawar respectively, in 2015. It has virtually remained the same in Tarai over the last two decades. Hence the rate of forest decline over the last six decades was high in arable areas of river valleys and Bhawar. The highest rate of deforestation was observed in the west, compared to the east and central part of the Chure-Tarai region. The proportion of shrub/grass areas increased notably in the Chure hill slopes, inner river valleys, and Duns. This implies a degradation of forest, which is a threat to the ecology and stability of such fragile slopes and terrain. Although conversion from forest to cultivated land is a general trend in recent decades, reclamation of forest, shrub, or grass from abandoned or damaged cultivated areas represents quite a significant characteristic of the internal dynamics of land cover change. This is attributable to abandonment of cultivated terraces on marginal hill slopes and damage caused by floods, channel shifts, and bank erosion on low land. Apart from the historical drivers, contemporary drivers of land cover change are demographics, development and increasing physical access and mobility, and urbanization. Illegal settlements on public forest land or encroachment on the land mainly by the landless, poverty stricken, and disaster hit people, as well as political instabilities, a continued dependency on forest resources, over grazing, forest fires, landslides, erosion, and floods are also recognized drivers of change. Forest and land resource degradation, loss or threat to biodiversity, increased landslide and flood disaster, the disruption of river and wetland ecology, and the depletion of ground water resources represent noticeable evidence of the negative consequences of an environment associated with the processes of land cover change.",NA,NA,"webofscience","historical land covers change in the chure-tarai landscape in the last six decades: drivers and environmental consequences","paper_761"

Forest carbon sink is an important ecosystem to sequestrate carbon for mitigating climate change which is a supplementary measure in addition to the strategies of energy saving and emission reduction. The role of institutional freedom playing in forest protection and which path to achieve forest carbon sink development are worthy of research. The nexus between the social, economic, and the environment should be explored. This paper uses data of 139 countries to explore this problem and proposes three transfer paths assumptions of land use structure, education, and income inequality. The three hypotheses are verified by the mediating model. The three transfer paths are analyzed under different levels of economic growth by the mediating model combined with the threshold model. The results show that the role of education as a transfer path is very clear and income inequality can promote the increase of forest carbon sinks in the case of higher institutional freedom. The three path hypothesis conclusions and related policy implications are summarized by analyzing the results.",NA,NA,"webofscience","how does institutional freedom affect global forest carbon sinks? the analysis of transfer paths","paper_775"

Thus, the demand for groundwater use raised there what is specifically true for the Forest Experiment Center, managed by the NGO SOS Atlantic Forest and located within the Water Resources Management Unit (UGRHI) 10-Sorocaba and M & eacute;dio Tiet & ecirc;. Nowadays, there is incipient hydrogeochemical knowledge of those groundwater resources and, in addition to the area having suffered a severe water crisis, the water quality of the surface waters of this region is poor to regular, according to some reports, as a consequence of the activities developed there. Therefore, this study focused that site, aiming to get a better understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes occuring there and their implications for water quality, once the urban growth usually results in changes in the hydrologic cycle with possible pollutants releases. Physicochemical parameters and inorganic compounds of the waters were analyzed in order to identify possible anomalous concentrations of contaminants, especially those related to agricultural activities such as nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, since the area was used for agriculture before reforestation. The radionuclides radon (222Rn) and radium (226Ra) were also analyzed as the study area is located near the Botuxim deposit, a low-level nuclear waste disposal site that may be a possible source of contamination. Additional motivation for characterizing radon in the study area consisted on its use as a natural tracer to understand hydrogeological processes, as well as by its great risk to human health. This work has taken into account the results obtained during one monitoring campaign held for the following sampling: (1) nine tubular wells drilled at Tubar & atilde;o Aquifer System; (2) one surface water from a dam (reservoir) built in the area; (3) rainwater. Results show that groundwater samples are generally alkaline, with pH values between 6.24 and 8.51, and total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 67.22 to 119.17 mg/L. Those waters are slightly oxidizing, with Eh values between + 188 to + 284 mV. Most of groundwaters are sodium-bicarbonate dominated, except two samples that are mixed in terms of dissolved anions. The dam (reservoir) water and rainwater are mixed in terms of dissolved cations, but dominated by chloride (dam water) or bicarbonate (rainwater). The phosphate levels exceeded the Brazilian standards for human consumption in some samples, which is probably associated with the ancient agricultural activities of the region, because the aquifer's rocks are not naturally enriched in PO43-. 222Rn activity concentration reached a maximum value of 32.8 Bq/L, below of the previous WHO's recommended limit of 100 Bq/L, while the highest 226Ra activity concentration was 0.12 Bq/L, almost ten times lesser than the 1 Bq/L limit set by the WHO for drinking water. The findings of this investigation show that the radon and radium levels in the waters are within safe limits, indicating that probably there is no influence of the Botuxim deposit on the study area. Thus, the results of such hydrogeochemical survey are essential to ensure adequate planning and management of that region's water resources, helping to understand possible processes affecting the water quality in the area.",NA,NA,"webofscience","hydrogeochemical study at a reforestation area from itu city, são paulo state, brazil","paper_784"

Combining covariate matching and mediation analysis, we found a significant positive effect of the media campaign on the declared intention to purchase legally-sourced timber and the mediation effect of two out of three precursors of the theory of planned behaviors, namely attitude and subjective norms. This study provides critical inputs to frame future media campaign messages and, by demonstrating some consumers' interest in legal timber, to strengthen the domestic legitimacy of policies such as the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade.",NA,NA,"webofscience","impact of a media campaign on consumers' purchasing intentions of legal timber in cameroon","paper_790"

What explains the emergence of these laws? How are the rights conceived by these acts conceptualized, operationalized and pursued? What are the promises, challenges and risks legal, political and economic of enshrining socioeconomic entitlements as formal statutory rights? This paper engages these questions. In part 1, I argue that three slow-burning processes since the 1980s, distinct yet related, catalyzed India's new rights agenda: high socio-legal activism, rapid uneven development and the expanding popular foundations of its federal parliamentary democracy. Significantly, all three processes exposed the growing nexus between political corruption and socioeconomic inequality. Equally, however, each raised popular expectations for greater social justice that were only partly met. Part 2 of the paper evaluates India's new rights agenda. The promise of these new laws is threefold: they breach the traditional division of civil, political and socioeconomic rights, devise innovative governance mechanisms that enable citizens to see the state and provide fresh incentives for new political coalitions to emerge across state and society. Several risks exist, however. Official political resistance from above and below, the limited capacities of judicial actors, state bureaucracies and social forces and the relatively narrow base of many of these new movements endanger the potential of these reforms. The paper concludes by considering several imperatives that India's evolving rights movement must confront to realize its ambition.",NA,NA,"webofscience","india's new rights agenda: genesis, promises, risks","paper_820"

These areas have been significantly deforested over the last 50 years due to public policies and land privatization aiming at economic development, agricultural and agribusiness expansion in Central and Amazonian Brazil. These political and economic drivers contributed to the conversion of five million hectares of Seasonal Evergreen Forests and Cerrados (Brazilian savanna) into agricultural land. In order to reverse the damaging trends of the future of the Xingu River and promote common benefits to indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, the Campaign fostered the creation of the Xingu Seed Network to promote exchange and commercialization of native seeds demanded by farmers and landholders for planting and restoring permanent preservation areas, such as riparian forests, and vegetation associated with lakes and springs of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin. The aim of this study is to examine the role played by the ?Y Ikatu Campaign in the conservation of these common-pool resources ? Xingu?s headwaters, riparian forests and rivers?and in mobilizing heterogeneous social groups living in this region to engage in the protection of the watershed.. Our analysis focuses on socially and culturally diverse inhabitants (indigenous and farmers) of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin, who are searching for innovative technologies for the recovery of riparian areas, and for income generation for local communities. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework was adopted as an approach for understanding interactions of multiple social agents, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, engaged in the process of restoration and protection of common resources. Spatial and temporal land-cover changes analysis of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin show an increase in deforestation during the past 40 years, primarily for soybean farming and pastures. We showed that indigenous people have a fundamental role in questioning and advancing the outcomes of restoration efforts, and monitoring environmental impact on water quality of rivers, as well as on conditions of forests and other ecosystems surrounding indigenous lands. We discuss the perspectives of K?se?dje? indigenous inhabitants of the environmental governance related to restoration efforts and monitoring, and their concerns with a dynamic scenario of agribusiness expansion in the Xingu River Headwaters region.",NA,NA,"webofscience","indigenous territories and governance of forest restoration in the xingu river (brazil)","paper_822"

This research adds to our understanding of environmental degradation by evaluating the contested'' role international nongovernmental organizations play in managing environmental problems. Methods. I use cross-national data for a sample of up to 70 nations to examine the effect of international nongovernmental organizations on deforestation for the period of 1990 to 2000. The models also include relevant controls for gross national product, economic growth, population growth, democracy, government expenditures, domestic investment, forest stocks, exports, multinational corporations, and structural adjustment. Results. The main findings indicate that nations with higher levels of international nongovernmental organizations presence have lower levels of deforestation. I also examine the effects of international nongovernmental organizations at different levels of democracy by including an interaction term between international nongovernmental organizations and democracy. In doing so, I find that international nongovernmental organizations continue to reduce deforestation. However, they reduce deforestation more at higher rather than at lower levels of democracy. Conclusions. This research illustrates that international nongovernmental organizations reduce deforestation despite claims to the contrary. However, their effectiveness appears to be affected by the level of democracy in a nation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","international nongovernmental organizations and deforestation: good, bad, or irrelevant?","paper_841"

Most of these emissions are attributed to losses from aboveground terrestrial pools such as deforestation. However, much less is known about the effects of land use change on soil carbon pools at regional scales. To address this problem, relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), land use/land cover (LULC) classes, and LULC change were investigated at the regional scale. A legacy soil survey was used in conjunction with a new, contemporary sampling campaign to determine SOC change through time. Together, the two datasets cover an approximate 40-year time period (1965 to 2009). The greatest densities of SOC were documented in wetland classes. Specifically, soils of Hardwood Swamp, Cypress Swamp, and Mixed Urban consisted of both residential Wetland Forest contained 9.8, 9.5, and 7.8 g C m(-2). In regard to absolute storage, or SOC stocks, Hardwood Swamp, Pineland, and Urban ranked highest and contained 14.4, 13.3, and 9.9 Tg C, respectively. The effect of LULC change was mixed, and resulted in both gains and losses of SOC at the field scale. At the regional scale, median SOC increased by 16.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Urbanization of natural landscapes resulted in the largest rate of sequestration, which increased SOC by 37.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The largest losses were documented in LULC classes converted from Improved Pasture to Rangeland, which decreased SOC by 8.5 g m(-2) yr(-1). (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, pristine peat swamp forests are vanishing due to deforestation and peatland degradation, especially in Southeast Asia. CO2 emissions associated with this land use change might not only come from the peat soil directly but also from peat-draining rivers. So far, though, this has been mere speculation, since there has been no data from undisturbed reference sites. We present the first combined assessment of lateral organic carbon fluxes and CO2 outgassing from an undisturbed tropical peat-draining river. Two sampling campaigns were undertaken on the Maludam River in Sarawak, Malaysia. The river catchment is covered by protected peat swamp forest, offering a unique opportunity to study a peat-draining river in its natural state, without any influence from tributaries with different characteristics. The two campaigns yielded consistent results. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged between 3222 and 6218 mu mol L-1 and accounted for more than 99% of the total organic carbon (TOC). Radiocarbon dating revealed that the riverine DOC was of recent origin, suggesting that it derives from the top soil layers and surface runoff. We observed strong oxygen depletion, implying high rates of organic matter decomposition and consequently CO2 production. The measured median pCO(2) was 7795 and 8400 mu atm during the first and second campaign, respectively. Overall, we found that only 32 +/- 19% of the carbon was exported by CO2 evasion, while the rest was exported by discharge. CO2 outgassing seemed to be moderated by the short water residence time. Since most Southeast Asian peatlands are located at the coast, this is probably an important limiting factor for CO2 outgassing from most of its peat-draining rivers.",NA,NA,"webofscience","lateral carbon fluxes and co2 outgassing from a tropical peat-draining river","paper_891"

In this review, we outline the theoretical links between democracy and biodiversity conservation and review the empirical literature testing them. While more studies reported a positive than a negative relation between democracy and biodiversity conservation (15 vs. 11), the most common result was a mixed relationship (28), often conditioned on economic factors. The use of different proxies to measure biodiversity, including deforestation, protected areas, threatened species, and fishery statistics emerged as a primary obstacle for synthesis. We suggest overcoming this caveat together with a consistent definition of democratic institutions and a standardized statistical framework as research priorities to improve policies against the global biodiversity loss.",NA,NA,"webofscience","linking democracy and biodiversity conservation: empirical evidence and research gaps","paper_905"

This study reviews the current status of mangrove ecology, management and conservation in Sri Lanka. In 2015, Sri Lanka became the first nation to legally protect all its mangrove forests; hence mangrove management in Sri Lanka may act as an important exemplar for other nations. Mangroves are found sporadically in the coastal area of Sri Lanka, including as a few dense mangrove forests. Mangrove vegetation provides a cost-effective ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction capability in Sri Lanka, particularly in the areas with poor living standards. Mangroves are used for timber, fishing materials, medicine and food in the country. Despite the environmental and socioeconomic importance of mangroves, several threats, including the expansion of aquaculture and agriculture, urbanization, pollution, climate change and sea level rise, exist in Sri Lanka. Many mangrove reforestation and afforestation initiatives in Sri Lanka have not succeeded, often because of the lack of sufficient monitoring of seedlings after the reforestation campaign and poor selection of planting sites without proper assessment of environmental conditions. In order to protect mangrove forests in Sri Lanka, some immediate measures need to be implemented. Proper planting of seedlings, community-based mangrove reforestation, sustainable aquaculture practices and proper legal enforcement are some of the important steps for the conservation of this highly productive ecosystem in the country.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Mangroves have been observed in field studies, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to offer some degree of protection from tsunamis and hurricanes. The magnitude of energy reduction strongly depends on three major factors, namely mangrove structures, topography-bathymetric features and wave characteristics. Mangroves are vulnerable and resilient to a variety of coastal disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic. Their vulnerability and resilience depend on the intensity, duration and frequency of the disturbances. Tsunamis and hurricanes are infrequent disturbances of high intensity and short duration. Sea-level rise and mangrove deforestation, on the other hand, are chronic events that evolve gradually over a longer period. A relentless government-community campaign is needed to cultivate awareness and education regarding the vulnerability of mangroves and their invaluable ecological services. Both soft and hard approaches are needed to reduce the adverse impacts of coastal disturbances on humans and mangroves.",NA,NA,"webofscience","mangrove forests: protection against and resilience to coastal disturbances","paper_935"

In many forested landscapes, the largest impacts of land use on forest structure are driven by forest management activities, which can include invasive species control, prescribed fire, partial harvests (e.g. shelterwood harvests) or overstory removals and clearcuts. Active timber management is often used to achieve forest conservation objectives, but to be used effectively, managers require knowledge of harvest frequency and extent in adjacent forests and at landscape scales. In this paper, we develop a timber harvest mapping workflow using machine learning (XGBoost algorithm) and single campaign airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys for the state of Pennsylvania, USA. We show that harvest type (shelterwood and overstory removals) can be mapped at high accuracy (overall accuracy = 94.9%), including broad age classes defined by the number of years since harvest. Errors of omission (false negatives) were lowest for recent (<10 yr old) overstory removal harvests (1.5%) and highest for older (10-18 yr old) shelterwood harvests (34.9%), which is consistent with the expectation that older, partial timber harvests are more difficult to distinguish from untreated forests than are recent harvests. Errors of commission (false positives) were low (<6.0%) for all timber harvest types and ages. Analysis of model results across both public and private lands in three highly forested conservation regions of Pennsylvania (the Poconos, PA Wilds, and Laurel Highlands) revealed a propensity for young overstory removals along forest edges, suggesting edge effects from inaccuracies in the underlying forest mask and mixed pixels contribute to errors of commission. Acknowledging this, overstory removal and shelterwood harvests were roughly equally common across public and private lands when expressed as a fraction of all interior forests (forests >30 m from an edge). The expectation that these harvest treatments would be rarer in private forests was not supported by the model results, which is likely due to the model's inability to distinguish between alternative natural processes (weather damage, wildfire, pathogens, etc.) and forest treatment types (high-grading and firewood collection) that result in similar forest structures to the trained classes in the XGBoost model. This study provides a framework and validation for combining approachable machine-learning techniques with large-campaign LiDAR to accurately predict forest structure with application to a host of forestry, natural resource, and conservation-related problems.

Most of the devastated forests have been afforested by the large-scale afforestation campaign in the 1970s through 1980s on a national level in Korea; for this reason, there have been very few places currently available for afforestation and reforestation. Therefore, the domestic forest policy in accordance with the UNFCCC should focus on how to ensure carbon sinks through forest tending activities (forest management) with the plan, in which 4.9million ha of stand for production forest land are recognized as greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks by 2022 rather than on how to obtain them through afforestation. In addition, the methods of the afforestation,of marginal agricultural land with low productivity and the formation and expansion of urban forest have been established to overcome the limitations of forest land area where afforestation could be performed. Furthermore, the policy of preventing forest disaster, controlling deforestation and expanding forest bio-energy and the use of wood products has been performed as the measures of carbon emission source. If such forest policies corresponding to the UNFCCC are proceeded while people are having a wide range of understanding on the public interest of forest, it is estimated that they will have a positive reaction.",NA,NA,"webofscience","measures of forest sector corresponding to the unfccc in korea","paper_951"

Meso-scale models were run in 1-D and 3-D mode for the area of Rondonia State, Brazil. The important conclusions are that without calibration it is difficult to model the energy partitioning of pasture; modelling that of forest is easier due to the absence of a strong moisture deficit signal. The simulation of the boundary layer above forest is good, above deforested areas (pasture) poor. The models' underestimate of the temperature of the boundary layer is likely to be caused by the neglect of the radiative effects of aerosols caused by biomass burning, but other factors such as lack of sufficient entrainment in the model at the mixed layer top may also contribute. The Andes generate patterns of subsidence and gravity waves, the effects of which are felt far into the Rondonian area. The results show that the picture presented by GCM modelling studies may need to be balanced by an increased understanding of what happens at the meso-scale. The results are used to identify key measurements for the LBA atmospheric meso-scale campaign needed to improve the model simulations. Similar modelling studies are proposed for the wet season in Rondonia, when convection plays a major role.",NA,NA,"webofscience","meso-scale effects of tropical deforestation in amazonia: preparatory lba modelling studies","paper_955"

The paper concentrates on national-level stakeholders active in REDD+ in Nepal, and their perceptions of governance quality, with a discussion, given the focus of this special volume, that emphasizes inclusiveness, equality and resources (indicators of interest representation) and democracy, agreement and dispute settlement (indicators of decision-making). Respondents were selected from state (i.e. governmental) and non-state (i.e. civil society) interests from a range of sectors active in REDD+ at the national level. The results show that survey respondents generally found REDD+ to be inclusive, but did not consider that there was the necessary capacity, or resources, for meaningful participation. A concluding section reviews the framework applied, and comments on the nature of multi-stakeholder relations in contemporary global governance, and REDD+ specifically.",NA,NA,"webofscience","more equal than others? a comparative analysis of state and non-state perceptions of interest representation and decision-making in redd plus negotiations","paper_973"

Critics of this approach toward increasing biodiversity protection and social justice argue that campaign successes are often short-lived while proponents emphasize the potential of NGO campaigns to achieve positive environmental and social change in the absence of governmental legislation. Focusing on the recent forest conservation policy of Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a leading pulp and paper company operating in Southeast Asia, we analyze the challenges companies face in implementing sustainability commitments made as a result of NGO and market pressure. Drawing from research on policy implementation and corporate greening we identify key activities to help entrench APP's commitments in the company's operations. Furthermore, we suggest that a range of actions by different stakeholder groups can achieve broader effects of APP's commitments toward better environmental and social stewardship in the region's pulp and paper sector.

However, the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of large-scale forest restoration projects (FRP) in different climatic zones, and the trade-off between carbon sequestration and water consumption caused by FRP are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive examination of 2,778 counties in China, where the world's most ambitious FRP was executed during the past two decades. Results showed that, on average, each square kilometer of FRP yielded an additional 0.6 square kilometers of forests and contributed an extra 1354.9 tC to forest carbon storage, with the aridity index emerging as a key influencer. The actual expenditure incurred per ton of increased forest carbon storage amounted to approximately 118.9 USD in average, with the lowest in Southwest at 50.9 USD. The expansion of forest cover and enhanced biomass storage led to a notable increase in water consumption, and the trade-off was particularly pronounced in arid regions. Our study provides empirical evidence that FRP is an effective and cost-efficient climate change mitigation strategy for humid climate zones under current carbon prices.

Some studies suggest that more democratic countries are associated with lower rates of deforestation, whereas others report that such states might well be related to more clearing of forested land. We contribute to resolving the currently mixed evidence by re-examining, extending, and contextualizing the findings of one of the most recent empirical studies on how democracy affects deforestation. Based on a comprehensive empirical analysis using different data sources and estimation procedures, we show that levels of democracy are linked to deforestation in a U-shaped, curvilinear way: deforestation rates are less strongly pronounced in both the least and the most democratic states, but higher in partial democracies. In this U-shaped curve, however, the most democratic countries have a better forest-conservation record than states with lower democracy scores.",NA,NA,"webofscience","new evidence reveals curvilinear relationship between levels of democracy and deforestation","paper_989"

We use data from a sample of 60 nations for the period of 1990 to 2005. We find substantial support for the world polity theory that higher levels of both types of nongovernmental organizations are associated with lower rates of deforestation. We expand the analysis to test a political opportunity structure hypothesis that democracy enhances the ability of nongovernmental organizations to deal with the causes of forest loss.

Burma has made a transition from 50years of authoritarian rule to what its leaders call 'disciplined democracy'. This paper examines the likely consequences of the Bank's return for the forestry sector in Burma and the potential outcomes in forestry governance given the evolution of its development agenda over the past 25years. While measures to address deforestation have been applied in Southeast Asia, the success of forestry governance reforms depends to a large extent on their endorsement and adoption by local power structures and political figures, as well as on the nature of the political regime itself. The record on forestry governance in Southeast Asia is particularly poor and international financial organizations continue to neglect the local political economy of deforestation. Comparatively, few studies have attempted to investigate the relationship between types of political regimes and rates of deforestation. The paper examines two other new democracies in Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Cambodia), and the impact that governance reforms have had on their deforestation trends and land use, in order to contextualize the potential impact of the WBG's return to Burma. In Southeast Asia, powerful vested interests continue to outweigh the support inside governments or civil society for the forestry governance norms promoted by international organizations. The cases of Indonesia, Cambodia and Burma illustrate that deep patrimonial interests operate within the region and that local politics cannot be ignored by international organizations designing policy reforms. The WBG should effectively engage wherever possible with the local communities and a broad range of civil society groups before developing further initiatives.",NA,NA,"webofscience","norm diffusion and the limits to forestry governance reform in southeast asia's new democracies","paper_999"

Using a district-level panel data set from 2001 to 2016, we analyze variation in remotely sensed forest losses as well as measures of land-use licensing. We link these outcomes to political incentives arising before idiosyncratically-timed local mayoral elections as well as to price exposure measures based on oil palm soil suitability combined with global price variations for palm oil. Empirical results document increases of about 4% in deforestation in the year prior to local mayoral elections on average. Additionally, palm oil plays a crucial role in driving deforestation dynamics. Deforestation rates increase by 7% in places that experience a one standard deviation increase in local price exposure, but no upcoming elections. These effects are amplified to almost 19% larger forest losses in places that experience pre-election years and a standard deviation higher palm oil price exposure at the same time. We thus find clear evidence for economic and political incentives reinforcing each other as drivers of forest loss and land conversion for oil palm cultivation. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Census statistics from the arid state of Rajasthan show a :ide of forests reclaiming the land. These trends obscure crucial realities that continue to undermine the claims of the state: forest ecosystems continue to disappear, expanding cover is characterized by an ecologically narrow range of species, and forest management remains rooted in a decision structure that fails to educe local knowledge and experience. More fundamentally, the flaws in the Rajasthani forest campaign reflect an entrenched pattern that has long guided authorities in the region; to govern the landscape, the state must quite literally construct forests-as mental categories, discursive tropes, and material realities-where none have existed before. The material conditions of tree cover are, in this way, influenced by the discursive forms of forest imported into the region. This paper surveys the contradictory trends in Rajasthani land cover, interrogating the relationship between the forests that expand on paper and those that dwindle on the ground. In the process, the paper contributes to ongoing work in poststructural political ecology by asking how discourse matters in the reconstitution of material ecologies and by linking the construction,ion of ecological categories to the formation of landscapes.

To determine if forest-related policy demonstrates a paradigm shift toward forest protection, we identify and code a set of 218 national forest-related policy documents passed between 1999 and 2016. We determine whether a paradigmatic change in forest-related policy occurred and the mechanism by which change has or has not taken place through the interpretation of policy citation networks and statistical analysis of temporal relationships between forest related policy content and change over time. We find that there was a significant increase in the amount of Indonesian forest-related policy from 1999 to 2016 and that it was largely comprised of content that promotes forest protection and redefines the structure and funding for forest-related organizations. These content changes primarily occurred through the process of policy layering, when new policy does not amend or repeal old policy and regulation. We discuss current trends in the regulation of forest territory and flow in Indonesia and find further evidence of policy layering. Thus, although Indonesian forest-related policy demonstrates a paradigm shift, the layering process through which new policy was created allows for interpretable flexibility, which enables continued forest cover loss.",NA,NA,"webofscience","paradigm shift and business as usual through policy layering: forest-related policy change in indonesia (1999-2016)","paper_1023"

This kind of development has been promoted through international agreements like the Agenda 21, which achieved an improvement of the working conditions for NGOs. Within this treaty the signatory states are asked to promote participation by various social groupings in political decision processes. In general, participation is possible on different levels, be it on local, regional, national or international scale. The participation of NGO's on deciding processes in forest policy is facing positive as well as negative aspects. Problematic are the deficiency of democracy of many NGO's, the undermining of decisions due to eloquent minorities, probably with increased expenditure and an enormous amount of time due to the participation of numerous groupings. Nevertheless, the present political scene as well as forest policy can no longer be pictured without participatory attempts. They are to be understood as a possibility ro just encounter the continuously increasing demands rewards forestry and to use the influence of other groupings or parts of the public for the sake of the forest-ecosystem.

Combined with cloud-based computing resources, and data collection through the crowd, these solutions have substantially improved possibilities for monitoring changes in land resources, especially in areas with difficult accessibility and data scarcity. In this study, we developed and tested a participatory mapping methodology utilizing the open data catalogues and cloud computing capacity to map the previously unknown extent and species composition of forest plantations in the Southern Highlands area of Tanzania, a region experiencing a rapid growth of smallholder-owned woodlots. A large set of reference data, focusing on forest plantation coverage, species and age information distribution, was collected in a two-week participatory GIS campaign where 22 Tanzanian experts interpreted very high-resolution satellite images in Google Earth with the Open Foris Collect Earth tool developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The collected samples were used as training data to classify a multi-sensor image stack of Landsat 8 (2013-2015), Sentinel-2 (2015-2016), Sentinel-1 (2015), and SRTM derived elevation and slope data layers into a 30 m resolution forest plantation map in Google Earth Engine. The results show that the forest plantation area was estimated with high overall accuracy (85%). The interpretation accuracy of local experts was high considering general definition of forest plantation declining with increased details in interpretation attributes. The results showcase the unique value of local expert participation, enabling the collection of thousands of reference samples over a large geographical area in a short period of time simultaneously building the capacity of the experts. However, sufficient training prior to the data collection is crucial for the interpretation success especially when detailed interpretation is conducted in complex landscapes. Since the methodology is built on open-access data and software, it presents a highly feasible solution for repetitive land resource mapping applicable at different spatial scales globally.",NA,NA,"webofscience","participatory mapping of forest plantations with open foris and google earth engine","paper_1027"

Soil physicochemical characteristics in the mangroves have an intrinsic relationship with the vegetation. In Brazil, studies seeking to evaluate this relationship are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the soil physicochemical composition in the tree species in the mangrove of the Maracaipe river estuary, Ipojuca/PE, Brazil, by means of physicochemical analyzes of the soil in the species Rizhophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, Avicennia schaueriana and Conocarpus erectus. The species showed physicochemical characteristics different from those found in other studies regarding temperature, since the milder areas were the ones of R. mangle instead of A. schaueriana. Salinity does not appear to be a limiting factor in R. mangle, which showed greater adaptation to salinity variations, while to the species A. schaueriana, it seems to influence its distribution. The concentration of magnesium, sodium, calcium and potassium, arriving to the ecosystem by the tides, indicates the strong marine influence in the Maracaipe river estuary. The source of sediments with predominantly sandy characteristic for the estuary may be related to the deforestation of adjacent mangroves, sandbanks and vegetation. Greater rain contribution in the first campaign imposed changes in macronutrient concentrations in the species L. racemosa, A. schaueriana and C. erectus, which did not occur in R. mangle, which maintained the same pattern in both analyzed periods.",NA,NA,"webofscience","physicochemical soil composition in tree species of mangrove ecosystem","paper_1042"

Where transitions are underway or anticipated, historical precedent and methods for systematically assessing future trends should be used to anticipate likely threats to forest conservation and design appropriate and prescient policy measures to counteract them. Myanmar is transitioning from an authoritarian, centralized state with a highly regulated economy to a more decentralized and economically liberal democracy and is working to end a long-running civil war. With these transitions in mind, we used a horizon-scanning approach to assess the 40 emerging issues most affecting Myanmar's forests, including internal conflict, land-tenure insecurity, large-scale agricultural development, demise of state timber enterprises, shortfalls in government revenue and capacity, and opening of new deforestation frontiers with new roads, mines, and hydroelectric dams. Averting these threats will require, for example, overhauling governance models, building capacity, improving infrastructure-and energy-project planning, and reforming land-tenure and environmental-protection laws. Although challenges to conservation in Myanmar are daunting, the political transition offers an opportunity for conservationists and researchers to help shape a future that enhances Myanmar's social, economic, and environmental potential while learning and applying lessons from other countries.

Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) potentially offers a means of improving SAR-based estimates of forest biomass by quantifying canopy structural variability. The polarisation information is dependent on the scattering mechanisms, and the interferometric information can be used to determine the vertical location of these scattering events in the canopy. The CORSAR project (Carbon Observation and Retrieval from SAR), which is supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), has the objective to examine polarimetric decomposition and polarimetric SAR interferometry methods for estimating the effects of canopy structure in biomass-backscatter relationships. We present results from single-pass X-band interferometry and from the polarimetric coherence optimisation of repeat-pass L-band E-SAR data acquired during the SAR and Hyperspectral Airborne Campaign (SHAC 2000), and compare the InSAR DEM's with a LIDAR derived DEM that was acquired concurrently. Four approaches to carbon accounting using SAR and LIDAR remote sensing are discussed. Remotely sensed maps of vegetation carbon pools are presented.",NA,NA,"webofscience","potential of polarimetric sar interferometry for forest carbon accounting","paper_1066"

(2) How do local people perceive the impacts of PPAs? (3) How do perceived impacts differ between PPA ownership types and contexts? We used an Opportunities, Security and Empowerment research framework derived from local definitions of well-being. Results suggest that governing PPA actors (PPA administrations and Chilean government officials) viewed local people as threats to forest conservation goals, embraced exclusion from reserve governance, but encouraged self-governance among local people through educational campaigns promoting environmental stewardship and ecotourism entrepreneurship. PPA administrations avoided emerging participatory democracy approaches to ensure local resistance did not threaten their authority. Despite asymmetrical power relations, PPA-community partnerships were viewed locally as both improving and damaging well-being. Our findings suggest that the social impacts and consequences of PPAs facilitating ecotourism development should be subjected to the same level of scrutiny that has been given to public protected areas.",NA,NA,"webofscience","private protected areas, ecotourism development and impacts on local people's well-being: a review from case studies in southern chile","paper_1082"

How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario(1-6). We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends(7,8), the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy-savannah-prone-dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the model democracy view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.",NA,NA,"webofscience","projected strengthening of amazonian dry season by constrained climate model simulations","paper_1085"

The panel so declined by engaging in a pedantic exercise of dictionary jurisprudence in interpreting the SPS Agreement, misreading the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and undermining a principle of international environmental law that has been resoundingly re-affirmed by the majority of nations. Although the work of the WTO has generated several studies attempting linkages with titles such as Trade and . . . , it is submitted that when it comes to the environment, this emphasis puts the cart before the horse and the real issue should be The Environment and Trade instead of the other way around. Human survival depends on a sustainable environment. The WTO Agreement itself recognizes in its preamble that trade is a means to achieve higher societal aims such as general welfare, sustainable development and the optimal use of the world's resources. By green-lighting the export of GM Foods and subjecting restrictions on imports to the high level scrutiny of the SPS Agreement, the Panel ignored the legitimate concerns of significant stakeholder groups, delegitimized the precautionary principle, and elevated trade liberalization dogma over more general human welfare. Given the narrow focus of the Panel's remit under the SPS Agreement, it is undesirable that the final pronouncement of the status and application of the precautionary principle in international law should be left to a trade liberalization agenda-driven panel that lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many countries and stakeholders as well as democratic accountability. The global community, alarmed by credible reports of global warming, deforestation, overfishing, and other extreme forms of environmental degradation, has a right to an authoritative pronouncement on the status of the precautionary principle in international environmental law. This it could secure if the LW General Assembly, representing the nations of the world, were to ask the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the status of the precautionary principle in customary international law. The pronouncement of the Court, consisting of eminent jurists representing a broad spectrum of nations, would provide the much needed guidance on a subject that relates to human survival.",NA,NA,"webofscience","promoting global food democracy - gm foods, trade law, the environment & ethics","paper_1087"

Characterizing these properties usually requires long-term data, precluding characterization of rapid vegetation changes such as those increasingly occurring in the Anthropocene. Consequently, the characterization of rapid events is limited and only possible in a few specific areas. We use a campaign approach to characterize surface properties associated with vegetation structure. In our approach, a profiling LiDAR and hemispherical image analyses quantify vegetation structure and a portable mast instrumented with a net radiometer, wind-humidity-temperature stations in a vertical profile, and soil temperature-heat flux characterize surface properties. We illustrate the application of our approach in two forest types (boreal and semiarid) with disturbance-induced tree loss. Our prototype characterizes major structural changes associated with tree loss, changes in vertical wind profiles, surface roughness energy balance partitioning, a proxy for NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index), and albedo. Multi-day albedo estimates, which differed between control and disturbed areas, were similar to tower-based multiyear characterizations, highlighting the utility and potential of the campaign approach. Our prototype provides general characterization of surface and boundary-layer properties relevant for land surface models, strategically enabling preliminary characterization of rapid vegetation disturbance events.",NA,NA,"webofscience","prototype campaign assessment of disturbance-induced tree loss effects on surface properties for atmospheric modeling","paper_1096"

Therefore, not only the amount and location of forest removal has to be known (as is typically provided by scenarios), but also knowledge about the successional land-cover types and their relative areal proportions is needed. The main objective of this study was to identify these successional land-cover types and quantify their areal proportions in regions deforested during the past 37years around the city of Kisangani, D.R. Congo. The fallow vegetation continuum was categorized in different stages, adapted from existing classifications. Ground-truth points describing the present-day vegetation were obtained during a field campaign and used for supervised and validated land-cover classification of these categories, using the Landsat image of 2012. Areal proportions of successional land-cover types were then derived from the resulting land-cover map. The second objective of this study was to relate these areal proportions to time since deforestation, which is expected to influence fallow landscapes. Landsat images of 1975, 1990, and 2001 were analyzed. Present-day mature tree fallow is less abundant on areas deforested during 1975-1990. The relative areal proportions were used to refine a deforestation scenario and apply it to existing data-sets of LAI and canopy height (CH). Assuming a simple conversion of forest to cropland, the deforestation scenario projected a reduction of grid-cell-averaged CH from 25.5 to 7.5m (within deforested cells), whereas the refined scenarios that we propose show more subtle changes, with a reduced CH of 13m. This illustrates the importance of taking successional land cover correctly into account in environmental and climatological modeling studies.",NA,NA,"webofscience","quantifying successional land cover after clearing of tropical rainforest along forest frontiers in the congo basin","paper_1114"

Australia's tropical savannas occupy the northern quarter of the continent, a region of increasing interest for further exploitation of land and water resources. Land use decisions across this vast biome have the potential to influence the national greenhouse gas budget. To better quantify emissions from savanna deforestation and investigate the impact of deforestation on national GHG emissions, we undertook a paired site measurement campaign where emissions were quantified from two tropical savanna woodland sites; one that was deforested and prepared for agricultural land use and a second analogue site that remained uncleared for the duration of a 22-month campaign. At both sites, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was measured using the eddy covariance method. Observations at the deforested site were continuous before, during and after the clearing event, providing high-resolution data that tracked CO2 emissions through nine phases of land use change. At the deforested site, post-clearing debris was allowed to cure for 6 months and was subsequently burnt, followed by extensive soil preparation for cropping. During the debris burning, fluxes of CO2 as measured by the eddy covariance tower were excluded. For this phase, emissions were estimated by quantifying on-site biomass prior to deforestation and applying savanna-specific emission factors to estimate a fire-derived GHG emission that included both CO2 and non-CO2 gases. The total fuel mass that was consumed during the debris burning was 40.9 Mg C ha(-1) and included above-and below-ground woody biomass, course woody debris, twigs, leaf litter and C-4 grass fuels. Emissions from the burning were added to the net CO2 fluxes as measured by the eddy covariance tower for other post deforestation phases to provide a total GHG emission from this land use change. The total emission from this savanna woodland was 148.3 Mg CO2-e ha(-1) with the debris burning responsible for 121.9 Mg CO2-e ha(-1) or 82 % of the total emission. The remaining emission was attributed to CO2 efflux from soil disturbance during site preparation for agriculture (10 % of the total emission) and decay of debris during the curing period prior to burning (8 %). Over the same period, fluxes at the uncleared savanna woodland site were measured using a second flux tower and over the 22-month observation period, cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was a net carbon sink of 2.1 Mg C ha(-1), or 7.7 Mg CO2-e ha(-1). Estimated emissions for this savanna type were then extrapolated to a regional-scale to (1) provide estimates of the magnitude of GHG emissions from any future deforestation and (2) compare them with GHG emissions from prescribed savanna burning that occurs across the northern Australian savanna every year. Emissions from current rate of annual savanna deforestation across northern Australia was double that of reported (non-CO2 only) savanna burning. However, if the total GHG emission, CO2 plus non-CO2 emissions, is accounted for, burning emissions are an order of magnitude larger than that arising from savanna deforestation. We examined a scenario of expanded land use that required additional deforestation of savanna woodlands over and above current rates. This analysis suggested that significant expansion of deforestation area across the northern savanna woodlands could add an additional 3 % to Australia's national GHG account for the duration of the land use change. This bottom-up study provides data that can reduce uncertainty associated with land use change for this extensive tropical ecosystem and provide an assessment of the relative magnitude of GHG emissions from savanna burning and deforestation. Such knowledge can contribute to informing land use decision making processes associated with land and water resource development.",NA,NA,"webofscience","quantifying the relative importance of greenhouse gas emissions from current and future savanna land use change across northern australia","paper_1117"

I find that deforestation rates increase 8-10% in election years when an incumbent mayor runs for re-election, an amount equivalent to four percent of the total forest lost since the 2004 elections. Electoral deforestation cycles do not appear to be driven by changes in agricultural policy implementation and activity, but are linked to corruption and campaign finance, suggesting that weak institutional constraints facilitate electoral manipulation of forest resources. This phenomenon is not likely limited to Amazonian forests; re-election incentives could very well lead to misallocation of other natural resources in alternate geographies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Even when policies appear fair, the rural poor face severe biases in implementation. In addition, the poor must compete on an uneven playing field of class, ethnic and other social inequities and economic hurdles. With the development of the global forest (carbon) conservation strategy such as Reduced Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation (REDD), which is ushering in accelerated forest commodification, poor people living in forests risk further marginalisation, exclusion and rights abuses. This article examines how forestry policy and implementation maintain double standards on this uneven playing field in a manner that continues to exclude the rural poor from the natural wealth around them. Poverty is not just about being left out of economic growth. It is produced by the very policies that enable some to profit - today from timber, firewood and charcoal, tomorrow from carbon. For REDD interventions to support poverty alleviation, forestry policies must be radically reworked to counterbalance widespread regressive policies and structural asymmetries. To make forestry policy emancipatory, strong social protections or safeguards are still needed that require REDD and other interventions to support and work through local democratic institutions. Otherwise these policies will continue their regressive trends.",NA,NA,"webofscience","reducing redd risks: affirmative policy on an uneven playing field","paper_1147"

The cointegration results provide statistical evidence of long-run associations between economic growth, deforestation propensities and the quality of democracy. The elasticity estimates certify the validity of the EKC hypothesis for all the three indicators of deforestation used in this paper: forest area coverage, deforestation rate and net forest depletion rate. Moreover, controlling for democracy lowers the threshold level of growth beyond which the marginal impact of growth results in environmental betterment by reducing the deforestation propensities in Bangladesh. Moreover, democracy and economic growth are also seen to exert a combined impact on the growth-deforestation nexus. The estimated growth thresholds are above the current real GDP level of Bangladesh which reasons the nation's deforestation woes. Finally, the causality results also affirm causal associations between economic growth, deforestation and the quality of democracy. Thus, these findings impose key policy implications keeping into cognizance the sustainable economic and environmental development goals of Bangladesh.",NA,NA,"webofscience","revisiting the deforestation-induced ekc hypothesis: the role of democracy in bangladesh","paper_1182"

It might be expected that after the changes restored political democracy in Spain in the late 1970s, a reorganization of the way the planning and implementation of soil and water conservation projects through reforestation would be changed. This paper considers the case of Guadalajara province as an example of the way in which reforestation has been effected at national level, and the consequences for the ecosystem. It examines how, since the 1940s, the technical methods used by forestry technicians have changed from concerns with protection to those of wood production. Although reforestation methods for wood production have been recognized as detrimental to soil and water conservation, they continue to be used even in the face of considerable opposition by local people and environmental pressure groups.

Mining is both the major cause of deforestation and the main economic activity in the country. A simple model of the incentives to hold mining property rights is developed and tested using a unique data-set of small-scale mining property rights data. Econometric techniques are used to test the findings of the model, concluding that the number of mining rights issued fall after election years, with the number rescinded rising. The introduction of REDD+ in Guyana also seems to have increased the number of mining claims being relinquished, and reduce the number being issued. The findings highlight the importance of political economy events in the evolution of small-scale mining activity, and show some evidence that the introduction of a REDD+ framework in Guyana has impacted the main driver of deforestation, despite the absence of specific policy targeting the sector.

Systematic sampling technique was employed to select 78 respondents for the study out of a population of 314 forest officers. Data were collected through validated structured interview schedule. Data were analyzed using percentage and mean scores. The major effective extension role of forest officers in forest conservation were creating awareness through environmental enlightenment campaign in forest communities ((x) over bar = 2.61) and dissemination of information in relation to public participation in forest conservation ((x) over bar = 2.61). The Major training needs of forest officers in forest conservation were sustainable forest management practices ((x) over bar = 3.39), forestry extension practices ((x) over bar = 3.32) and developing group participation. The most serious constraints to effective forestry extension service delivery were inadequate funding ((x) over bar = 2.97), and lack of vehicles for field staff logistics ((x) over bar = 2.80).). Forestry extension service delivery in forest conservation was less effective, owing to a great number of constraints militating against the service delivery. For extension role of forest officers in forest conservation to be more effective in the state, there is need for extension unit to be created by the Cross River State Forestry Commission and specifically saddled with the responsibility of carrying out forestry extension functions along with the readiness of the state government to adequately coordinate and fund forestry extension services.",NA,NA,"webofscience","role of extension forest officers in forest conservation in cross river state, nigeria","paper_1195"

Using GlobalTreeSearch and GTA data, the analysis reveals that China boasts some 4886 native tree species of which virtually half, 2429, are endemic to the country. With nearly one in five Chinese tree species threatened, conservation action has been implemented under the umbrella of the GTC for some hundred taxa. This included development of best-practice in propagation, population recovery in situ and creation of ex situ conservation collections as an insurance policy for the future. Although urgency prevails to scale up conservation action for many more species at the brink of extinction, the GTC offers an ecologically more nuanced conceptual framework for application in China's large-scale tree planting and reforestation efforts. This integrated approach is especially opportune now, at a time when China is reviewing the effectiveness and plans for expansion of its protected area system, but is also compelled to increase forest cover for carbon capture and economic growth. The GTC provides a comprehensive method to ascertain planting the 'right tree in the right place', but also 'for the right purpose at the right time and with the right care'.",NA,NA,"webofscience","safeguarding china's native trees - a review of integrated conservation practices between 2008 and 2020","paper_1207"

The extent of the area affected by fire was estimated with a contextual active fire detection algorithm, and with a burnt area mapping approach, based on multiple fuzzy thresholds. The latter was considered to produce more accurate results. In a study area of 2 x 10(6) km(2), and during a 5-week period, the areas affected were estimated at 112,578 and 525,820 km(2) by the active fires and burnt area algorithms, respectively. Biomass densities, combustion factors, and emissions factors for Sudanian savanna, Guinean savanna, and dense tropical forest vegetation types were obtained from the literature, and used to estimate biomass burnt (228-371 Tg), and pyrogenic emissions of aerosols (1.8-2.6 Tg) and of the trace gases CO2 (374-609 Tg), CO (29.2-39.0 Tg), CH4 (2.05-2.73 Tg), and NOx (1.1-1.4 Tg). Because of its high biomass density, the tropical forest was a major source of atmospheric emissions, in spite of the relatively small extent of area burnt in this ecosystem. This highlights the need for particularly accurate estimates of area burnt, biomass density, combustion factor, and emissions factor for the dense tropical forest, as well as the potential for a significant increase in regional pyrogenic emissions as a consequence of deforestation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","satellite monitoring of fire in the expresso study area during the 1996 dry season experiment:: active fires, burnt area, and atmospheric emissions","paper_1208"

The presented analysis demonstrates the use of satellite observations for interpreting the effects of deforestation and climate on past and future emissions of CO. The study exploits the MOPITT multispectral retrieval product which effectively resolves tropospheric CO into two independently measured layers. New validation results based on in situ measurements during the ACRIDICON-CHUVA aircraft campaign in 2014 are used for bias correction. Contrasting CO monthly climatologies are presented for the Amazon Basin for the lower and upper troposphere (LT and UT) with an emphasis on the Amazonian dry season. Climatologically, spatial patterns of UT CO over the Amazon Basin appear to be related to both deep convection and anticyclonic flow. Strongly enhanced LT basin-mean CO concentrations are observed for the dry season months in 2005, 2007, 2010, and 2015, while the record also indicates a decreasing long-term trend. These observations are consistent with the expected effects of falling deforestation rates since 2004, punctuated by CO spikes in drought years due to large-scale wildfires. Plain Language Summary Satellite observations of carbon monoxide (CO) from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere instrument since 2000 are used to analyze pollution from fires in the Amazon Basin. It is shown that decreasing deforestation can result in reduced levels of CO, but that fires related to climate variability produce larger changes in CO concentrations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","satellite-based analysis of co seasonal and interannual variability over the amazon basin","paper_1209"

A total of 70 LAI measurements were taken from different forest types in the same areas one month later, and some spectroradiometric measurements were also collected from the nearby highway and different forest stands in the areas. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of the three types of AVIRIS data used for estimating and mapping LAI. The three types of data correspond to AVIRIS original radiance (OR), corrected radiance (CR) and retrieved surface reflectance (SR). We first simulated the total at-sensor radiances using MODTRAN4, then used ground spectroradiometric measurements taken from different targets to improve the reflectances for each pixel on the image. The CR images were obtained by subtracting path radiance from the OR images. A 10-term LAI prediction model for each type of data was constructed to predict pixel-based LAI values. Finally, the pixel-based LAI value was sliced and mapped for all the three types of images. The results of mapping LAI using the three types of AVIRIS data (OR, CR and SR) indicate that mapping LAI by SR is the most realistic, followed by CR. The poorest result occurs when mapping LAI with OR data due to atmospheric effect. The SR data can lead to higher correlation with LAI in some bands and produce higher accuracy indices for the 10-term predictive model, although some indices from the test set for SR data have a somewhat lower correlation with LAI than those produced with OR data. Therefore, in general, it can be concluded that the retrieved surface reflectance data is more effective for mapping forest LAI compared to the other two types of data.",NA,NA,"webofscience","simple calibration of aviris data and lai mapping of forest plantation in southern argentina","paper_1233"

Over the last years, the spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor specifically designed to acquire forest structure information, Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), has been used to extract forest canopy height information over large areas. Yet, GEDI has no spatial coverage for most forested areas in Canada and other high latitude regions. On the other hand, the spaceborne LiDAR called Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides a global coverage but was not specially developed to study forested ecosystems. Nonetheless, both spaceborne LiDAR sensors obtain point-based information, making spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation very challenging. This study compared the performance of both spaceborne LiDAR, GEDI and ICESat-2, combined with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 and -2 data to produce continuous canopy height maps in Canada for the year 2020. A set-aside dataset and airborne LiDAR (ALS) from a national LiDAR campaign were used for accuracy assessment. Both maps overestimated canopy height in relation to ALS data, but GEDI had a better performance than ICESat-2 with a mean difference (MD) of 0.9 m and 2.9 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.2 m and 5.2 m, respectively. However, as both GEDI and ALS have no coverage in most of the hemi-boreal forests, ICESat-2 captures the tall canopy heights expected for these forests better than GEDI.

It addresses a contemporary conflict in the region, where an Indigenous people, the Munduruku, are resisting efforts by the Brazilian State to channelize the Tapajos River and exploit its hydropower potential. Development here represents an existential threat to the Munduruku, whose homeland resides in the river valley. It also represents an ecological threat to the global community. Although the rate of deforestation dropped after the turn of the millennium, it has begun to climb again and would no doubt accelerate with development in the Tapajos watershed and the opening of Central Amazonia to colonization and resource extraction. This would push the forest past its tipping point, a magnitude of deforestation capable of compromising rainfall recycling, and thus precipitating the transformation of the Amazonian forest into a patchwork of fireadapted shrubs and grasses. Tapajos describes how such an ecological catastrophe would occur. It also argues that the assertion of Indigenous territorial rights is key to the conservation of Amazonian biodiversity. The account unfolds against a background of conflict between Amazonia's Indigenous peoples and the Brazilian State. In so doing, it brings to life the realities of frontier violence involving both land conflict and the unrestrained behaviors of individuals living outside the institutional constraints of law. Such violence complicates the execution of field research in the region and contributes to its gathering ecological crisis.",NA,NA,"webofscience","tapajos","paper_1294"

For the generation of thematic maps was used to LEGAL Analysis (GIS Spatial Algebraic Language), tool that enables spatial analysis using map algebra. From the generation of thematic maps were calculated areas where there was the expansion of native forests (7.55% of total area) - areas where natural regeneration has occurred, becoming forest in 2010. The area that has remained the use of native forest over 18 years is 2.83% of the total area. Deforestation, forest areas belonging to native and has reverted to another use, is 1.23%. Reforestation, represented by the areas that now belong to the class planted forest was quantified at 0.57% of the total area of microregion. The remaining land use change (86.98% of total area) were among the other classes of land use. The work allowed us to observe the changes in land use over a period of 18 years, it was observed an increase in forest area, both native and planted.

It is hypothesized that differences in deforestation among countries can be attributed to their colonial legacies shaping the current impact of the institutional background on deforestation. Overall, the author finds that institutions defined as the extent of democracy, the quality of property rights and the quality of government functioning (e.g., corruption), have a differential impact on deforestation rates according to colonial legacies as defined by the identity of the colonizer. More precisely, it is found that: (1) in countries characterized by 'bad' governance, former French colonies deforest relatively less than former British and Spanish colonies; whereas (2) in countries characterized by 'good' governance, the result is reversed. These results are robust when geography features are controlled for since the process of colonization was not random and depended on initial geographic and climatic conditions.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the colonial origins of deforestation: an institutional analysis","paper_1321"

Agroforestry, a system in which woody perennials are grown on the same land as agricultural crops or livestock, has been increasingly enlisted in the campaign to meet these threats to the rural economy. Case studies of twenty-one agroforestry projects in six Central American and two Caribbean countries formed the empirical basis for the study described in this article. A focal point of analysis was the profitability of agroforestry for farmers as a crucial incentive to adoption. The findings indicate that many agroforestry practices are profitable under a broad range of conditions and are therefore likely to be widely applicable. Successful projects have worked with local communities, responding to local needs and preferences and offering farmers a broad basket of species and systems from which to choose. Demonstration plots and the use of paratechnicians have been low-cost and effective means of technology transfer, and applied research has been important in identifying techniques and practices suited to the region. Other findings have identified government regulation of tree harvesting and insecurity of tenure-though not lack of title in itself-as disincentives to adoption.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the costs and benefits of agroforestry to farmers","paper_1329"

Although decentralization is a good example of such a contextual phenomenon in multiple locations globally, it is rare to find quantitative empirical analyses of how it moderates PA effectiveness. We evaluate how the decentralization in Indonesia (proxied by the introduction of direct elections, district head (bupati) change, and district splitting) influenced PA effectiveness between 2000 and 2008. Focusing on three outcomes -deforestation, forest fragmentation, and fires, we apply a quasi-experimental approach to a carefully constructed spatially explicit village-level panel dataset, combined with geospatial biophysical and physio-geographic data. We hypothesize that the moderating influence of decentralization on PA effectiveness depends on whether decentralization increased threats to forests, strengthened local accountability, or weakened enforcement. On average, we find direct elections improved the PA impact in terms of reducing deforestation in protected villages, but had no statistically significant effect on forest fragmentation, fires, or leakage. On average, we find district splitting increased forest fragmentation in the recently protected villages, but had no statistically significant impact on deforestation and fires. On average, we find the bupati change had no statistically discernible influence on PA impacts on deforestation, fragmentation or fires. Given the increasing threats to forests due to decentralization, these results imply that district splitting and the bupati change weakened enforcement inside PAs with regards to deforestation and forest fragmentation, in contrast to direct elections. By highlighting the potential channels through which decentralization in Indonesia impacted forests, we offer insights into the effectiveness of a common conservation policy in the country. Broadly, we contribute to the conservation impact evaluation literature by quantitatively examining how political economy influences the performance of conservation policies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

One salient aspect of the spread of commercial liberalism in the world has been the growth in international trade. The spread of republican liberalism has manifested itself by the rise in the level of democracy in countries over time. What are the implications of trade and democracy for the terrestrial environment? Two bodies of literature are relevant to this question: one studies the effect of trade on the environment, while a second body focuses on the effect of democracy on the environment. The effects of both forces on the environment are debated theoretically and empirically. The two bodies of literature have generally developed separately, and the effects of trade and democracy have not been evaluated in the same model. This paper discusses the theoretical effects of trade and democracy on the environment, and develops a statistical model to study these effects on the terrestrial environment in the areas of deforestation and land degradation. The results indicate that a rise in trade openness reduces deforestation in autocracy and increases deforestation in democracy, and the effect is similar for the less developed countries (LDCs) and the developed countries (DCs). A rise in trade openness reduces land degradation, but the effect is not robust and does not depend on regime type. A rise in democracy increases deforestation and reduces land degradation, but these effects are weaker in LDCs than in DCs. In addition, the effect of democracy on deforestation is stronger when trade openness is high. The effect of democracy on land degradation does not depend on trade openness. The paper concludes with an examination of the implications of these results for public policy.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the effects of liberalism on the terrestrial environment","paper_1348"

Samples, collected by local forestry workers (Forest Enterprise staff) on a campaign basis on up to eight occasions, were for 16 mature first rotation standing forest: the remainder represented areas completely clear felled from less than one to up to forty years previously. As the waters drain acidic and acid sensitive soils, acidic runoff is often encountered. However, higher pH values with associated positive alkalinities and base cation enrichments are observed due to the influence of weathering reactions within the bedrock. There is little systematic variation in water quality between baseflow and stormflow for each site indicating a complex and erratic contribution of waters from the soil and underlying parent material. 80% or more of the data points show hardly any changes with felling time, but there are a few outlier points with much higher concentrations that provide important information on the processes operative. The dearest outlier felling response is for nitrate at five of the more recently felled sites on brown earth, gley and podzolic soil types. ANC, the prime indicator of stream acidity, shows a diverse response from both high to low outlier values (>+400 to -300 mu Eq/1). In parallel to nitrate, aluminium, potassium and barium concentrations are higher in waters sampled up to 4 years post felling, but the time series response is even less clear than that for nitrate. Cadmium, zinc and lead and lanthanides/actinides show large variations from site to site due to localized vein ore-mineralization in the underlying bedrock. The survey provides a strong indication that forest harvesting can have marked local effects on some chemical components of runoff for the first four years after felling but that this is confined to a small number of sites where nitrate production and aluminium leaching are high. In general, deforestation leads to a reversal of acidification when the nitrate pulse is low. The variability in water quality from catchment to catchment is too high for generalized conclusions to be made over the extent of the potential changes from site to site. The value of an organised campaign of opportunistic sampling using an infrastructure of enthusiastic staff from regionally dispersed organisations associated with environmental matters (in this case the forestry industry) is highlighted.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the impacts of conifer harvesting on runoff water quality: a regional survey for wales","paper_1379"

The most important factor behind this rapid decline in BES has been attributed to the different land use changes such as agricultural expansion, urbanization, and deforestation practices. Therefore, the present study intends to understand the impacts of land use changes along with the effects of egalitarian democracy, human capital and globalization on BES taking a sample of 20 countries where ecosystem services and biodiversity are most fragile during 1990-2019 period. The study employs robust econometric models that can tackle the problem of cross-sectional dependence within the data. The finding demonstrates that agricultural expansion and urbanization both negatively and significantly affect the BES whereas forest area is positively associated with BES. The impacts of egalitarian democracy, human capital development as well as that of globalization are found to be decreasing the BES loss. Finally, some policy recommendations are provided to offset the loss of BES which can serve as the benchmark for developing policy interventions across the countries.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the impacts of land use change on biodiversity and ecosystem services: an empirical investigation from highly fragile countries","paper_1380"

The implementation of a simple land surface parameterization, Interactions between Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA), has gained from previous validations and calibrations at local scale against field datasets and from aggregation procedures devised to define effective land surface properties. Specific improvements for climate purposes are introduced: spatial variability of convective rainfall in canopy drainage estimation and subsurface gravitational percolation. The methodology used to derive climatological maps of land surface parameters at the grid-scale resolution of the model from existing databases for soil and vegetation types at global scale is described. A 3-yr integration for the present day climate with a T42L30 version of the climate model has been performed. Results obtained compare favorably with available observed climatologies related to the various components of the continental surface energy and water budgets. Differences are due mostly to a poor simulation of the precipitation field. However, some differences suggest specific improvements in the surface scheme concerning representation of the bare soil albedo, the surface runoff, and the soil moisture initialization. As a first step prior to tropical deforestation experiments presented in Part II, regional analyses over the Amazon forest indicate that the modeled evaporation and net radiation are in good agreement with data collected during the Amazon Region Micrometeorological Experiment campaign.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the land-surface scheme isba within the meteo-france climate model arpege .1. implementation and preliminary-results","paper_1387"

The extensive misuse of fire for deforestation or pasture management in Brazil has created an overall perception that its use is always deleterious. This view, reinforced by threats of global warming and climatic change, has lead to current policies of fire suppression. 2. Cerrado ecosystems depend on the historical fire regime to maintain their structure, biodiversity and functioning. The suppression of fire has transformed savanna vegetation into forests, causing biodiversity losses and drastic changes in ecological processes. 3. Policy implications. The National Fire Policy required by law must be urgently implemented in Brazil, including use of fire for Cerrado conservation in public and private lands on the basis of existing knowledge of indigenous people and scientists. Objective regulations on prescribed burning, land manager training, incentives for fire research and experimentation and a broad campaign to disseminate the benefits of fire for Cerrado conservation should be the cornerstones of the policy.

The paper examines the reasons for deforestation and investigates the factors accountable for it. The analysis builds on authors-compiled cross-national dataset on 185 countries over the time period of twenty years, from 1990 to 2010. We find that, first, nation's intelligence reduces significantly the level of deforestation in a state. Moreover, the nations' IQ seems to play an offsetting role in the natural resource conservation (forest management) in the countries with weak democratic institutions. The analysis also discovered the presence of the U-shaped relationship between democracy and deforestation. Intelligence sheds more light on this interconnection and explains the results. Our results are robust to various sample selection strategies and model specifications. The main implication from our study is that intelligence not only shapes formal rules and informal regulations such as social trust, norms and traditions but also it has the ability to reverse the paradoxical process known as resource curse. The study contributes to better understanding of reasons of deforestation and shed light on the debated impact of political regime on forest management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The objective was to damage the brand image of Nestle and, thereby, force the organization to make its supply chain more sustainable. Prominent cases such as these have led to the prevailing view that sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is primarily reactive and propelled by external pressures. This research, in contrast, assumes that SSCM can contribute positively to the reputation of an organization as a good citizen and, thereby, counter the impression that external stakeholder pressure is the only driver of SSCM. The study draws on Resource Dependence Theory in analyzing the three competing models of the potential stakeholder, SSCM and the corporate sustainability performance relationship. A dataset of 1,621 organizations allows the statistical comparison of these three models. Findings suggest that stakeholder pressure and SSCM both contribute to an organization's sustainability performance. Thus, supply chain managers will perceive benefits from SSCM other than merely the reduction of risk from reputational damage through stakeholder activism.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the relationship between sustainable supply chain management, stakeholder pressure and corporate sustainability performance","paper_1433"

Through advice, education and training, joint research and exchange of experiences, information and technical know-how, cooperation can bring together baseline information for the world's community. In this way, developed countries and international forestry and forestry research organizations can assist developing countries to enhance dialogue, partnerships and inter-relationships in forestry at a global level. NGOs also can play an intermediary role between government and the private sector. They are becoming increasingly important in facilitating the transfer of technology, for promoting public awareness and negotiating on international environment issues. Government support for NGOs has enabled the organizations to perform their work better and more efficiently. The establishment of the Northeast Asian Forest Forum (NEAFF) in Mongolia and China is timely and meaningful in the sense that the Mongolian and Chinese governments are working diligently to plant trees and combat desertification. The governments are no longer able to tolerate environmental degradation accumulated over the past several decades. NEAFF in Seoul fully supports the collaborative efforts between Korea, China and Mongolia, universities and research institutions in Korea, and international tree-planting NGOs in the international campaign to plant trees on bare lands and desert in China and Mongolia. Such efforts to expand projects in reforestation and combating desertification, especially within the two countries, will provide opportunities for neighbouring countries to expand their dialogue, as well as bridge differences, by addressing common environmental issues across these regions. A network is being developed, and part of this work is already in progress to promote synergies and comparative research on the forest ecosystems of northeast Asian countries. The key to a successful network is the coordination of activities by the participating countries.

Despite this value, tropical deforestation continues at a high rate. Emerging evidence suggests that elections can play an important role in shaping deforestation, for instance by incentivising politicians to allow increased utilisation of forests in return for political support. Nevertheless, the role of elections as driver of deforestation has not yet been comprehensively tested at broad geographic scales. Here, we created an annual database from 2001 to 2018 on political elections and forest loss for 55 tropical nations and modelled the effect of elections on deforestation. In total, 1.5 million km2 of forest was lost during this time period, especially in the Amazon, the Congo Basin and in Southeast Asia. The annual rate of deforestation increased in 37 (67 %) of the analysed countries. Deforestation was significantly lower in years with uncompetitive lower chamber elections compared to competitive election years (i.e. when the opposition can participate in elections and has a legitimate chance to gain governmental power). Our results show a pervasive loss of tropical forests and suggest that competitive elections can be potential drivers of deforestation. Future analyses at higher resolution (intra-annual defores-tation and sub-national governance) and simultaneous collection of data on additional mechanisms (legislative changes, financial investments, and binding term limits) will likely provide additional insights into the impacts of elections. We therefore recommend that organisations monitoring election transparency and fairness should also monitor environmental impacts such as forest loss, habitat destruction and resource exploitation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the role of elections as drivers of tropical deforestation","paper_1438"

Rural poverty is a serious phenomenon that poses a threat to economic opportunities, security and sustainable development of the rural poor. It involves land degradation caused by human-induced deforestation, agricultural and economic policies which negatively affect farming communities. Mass media play a greater role in reversing this trend in order to rescue the rural populace from the cycle of poverty, whose economic livelihood is directly dependent on land exploitation. Therefore, the paper examines role of print and electronic media in improving the lives of the rural poor. The study involved questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample respondents comprised of 200 staff of the media houses randomly selected. Therefore, to guide the study two hypotheses and three research questions were utilised. Similarly, the interview was conducted with five rural populace. The data collected were subjected to simple frequency count and percentage. Chi-squire statistical tools were used to test the null hypotheses. The findings of the study show that there is a significant relationship between unemployment and rural poverty. And there is no significant difference between media programmes and government campaign on rural poverty. The findings of the study also indicate that the role of mass media is public announcement, media jingles, sensitization and enlightenment campaign.

In most cases, about one-third of the fuel chlorine ended up in the particles and about one-half remained in the ash. About 50% of the mass of non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) emitted by these fires could be identified with the available instrumentation. The lab fire emission factors (EF, g compound emitted per kg dry fuel burned) were coupled with EF obtained during the TROFFEE airborne and ground-based field campaigns. This revealed several types of EF dependence on parameters such as the ratio of flaming to smoldering combustion and fuel characteristics. The synthesis of data from the different TROFFEE platforms was also used to derive EF for all the measured species for both primary deforestation fires and pasture maintenance fires - the two main types of biomass burning in the Amazon. Many of the EF are larger than those in widely-used earlier work. This is mostly due to the inclusion of newly-available, large EF for the initially-unlofted smoldering emissions from residual logs in pastures and the assumption that these emissions make a significant contribution (similar to 40%) to the total emissions from pasture fires. The TROFFEE EF for particles with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 microns (EFPM2.5) is 14.8 g/ka for primary deforestation fires and 18.7 g/kg for pasture maintenance fires. These EFPM2.5 are significantly larger than a previous recommendation (9.1 g/kg) and lead to an estimated pyrogenic primary PM2.5 source for the Amazon that is 84% larger. New regional budgets for biogenic and pyrogenic emissions were roughly estimated. Coupled with an estimate of secondary aerosol formation in the Amazon and source apportionment Studies, the regional budgets suggest that similar to 5% of the total mass of the regionally generated NMOC end up as secondary organic aerosol within the Amazonian boundary layer within 1-3 days. New global budgets confirm that biogenic emissions and biomass burning are the two largest global sources of NMOC with an estimated production of approximately 1000 (770-1400) and 500 (250-630) Tg/yr, respectively. It follows that plants and fires may also be the two main global Sources of secondary organic aerosol. A limited set of emission ratios (ER) is given for sugar cane burning which may help estimate the air quality impacts of burning C, this major or crop, which is often grown in densely populated areas.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the tropical forest and fire emissions experiment: laboratory fire measurements and synthesis of campaign data","paper_1456"

The airborne campaign used an Embraer 110B aircraft outfitted with whole air sampling in canisters, mass-calibrated nephelometry, ozone by UV absorbance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and proton-transfer mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) to measure PM10, O-3, CO2, CO, NO, NO2, HONO, HCN, NH3, OCS, DMS, CH4, and up to 48 non-methane organic compounds (NMOC). The Brazilian smoke/haze layers extended to 2 - 3 km altitude, which is much lower than the 5 - 6 km observed at the same latitude, time of year, and local time in Africa in 2000. Emission factors (EF) were computed for the 19 tropical deforestation fires sampled and they largely compare well to previous work. However, the TROFFEE EF are mostly based on a much larger number of samples than previously available and they also include results for significant emissions not previously reported such as: nitrous acid, acrylonitrile, pyrrole, methylvinylketone, methacrolein, crotonaldehyde, methylethylketone, methylpropanal, '' acetol plus methylacetate,'' furaldehydes, dimethylsulfide, and C-1-C-4 alkyl nitrates. Thus, we recommend these EF for all tropical deforestation fires. The NMOC emissions were similar to 80% reactive, oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC). Our EF for PM10 (17.8 +/- 4 g/kg) is similar to 25% higher than previously reported for tropical forest fires and may reflect a trend towards, and sampling of, larger fires than in earlier studies. A large fraction of the total burning for 2004 likely occurred during a two-week period of very low humidity. The combined output of these fires created a massive '' mega-plume '' > 500 km across that we sampled on 8 September. The mega-plume contained high PM10 and 10 - 50 ppbv of many reactive species such as O-3, NH3, NO2, CH3OH, and organic acids. This is an intense and globally important chemical processing environment that is still poorly understood. The mega-plume or '' white ocean '' of smoke covered a large area in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay for about one month. The smoke was transported > 2000 km to the southeast while remaining concentrated enough to cause a 3 - 4-fold increase in aerosol loading in the S (a) over tildeo Paulo area for several days.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the tropical forest and fire emissions experiment: overview and airborne fire emission factor measurements","paper_1457"

This tendency is even more marked in the Sudanian and Sahelian zones with a long dry season, and explains the lack of knowledge on the potential of native or local tree species and suitable sylvicultural methods. To contribute to the acquisition of this essential knowledge, a 2.56 ha arboretum was established in 1990 in the Korhogo area in northern Cote d'Ivoire. A particular feature lies in the establishment of large parcels (1,596 m(2)) with 224 saplings of each species. The aim was to allow sylvicultural treatment that would conserve 10 to 16 adult trees of each species, in particular for their timber, by the end of each rotation. Because nursery techniques for some of the species were insufficiently mastered, the 244 saplings per species initially planned were only planted for 12 of the 22 species. The results are shown for all of the species tested, both in the nursery and once planted out. This arboretum was regularly monitored until 1999, when proper management was disrupted by political upheaval in the country. A measurement campaign was set in motion in November 2019, which brought interesting conclusions as to the aptitude for growth of 15 species in even-aged single-species stands, two of which (Pterocarpus erinaceus Poir. and Anogeissus leiocarpa (DC.) Guill. & Perr.) show outstanding productivity. All of the data collected as from seed harvesting and throughout the life of the arboretum are presented and discussed here, in the hope that this will be of benefit to foresters in this phytogeographical area. The lessons learned should be applied to forest and landscape restoration through the reforestation commitments made by countries to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services to populations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","three decades of monitoring 22 native tree species planted in an arboretum in korhogo in northern cote d'ivoire","paper_1474"

However, the effects of titling on forest cover are unclear. Rigorous analyses of titling campaigns are rare, and related theoretical and empirical research suggests that they could either stem or spur forest damage. We analyze such a campaign in the Peruvian Amazon, where more than 1,200 indigenous communities comprising some 11 million ha have been titled since the mid-1970s. We use community-level longitudinal data derived from high-resolution satellite images to estimate the effect of titling between 2002 and 2005 on contemporaneous forest clearing and disturbance. Our results indicate that titling reduces clearing by more than three-quarters and forest disturbance by roughly two-thirds in a 2-y window spanning the year title is awarded and the year afterward. These results suggest that awarding formal land titles to local communities can advance forest conservation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","titling indigenous communities protects forests in the peruvian amazon","paper_1476"

As a response, international environmental agreements and related programs require information about tropical forested landscapes. Despite the increasing quantity and quality of remote sensing-based data, the effective monitoring of forests in the tropics still faces operational challenges: (a) applicability at local levels, with lack of reference or cloud-free information; (b) overcoming geographical, ecological, or biophysical variability; (c): stratification, distinguishing forest categories related to functionality and disturbance history. We conducted an extensive ground verification campaign through 36 landscapes in 9 regions of Zambia, Ecuador and Philippines, which constitute a gradient of pantropical deforestation contexts or forest transitions. We collected over 16,000 ground control points and digitized over 18,000 ha with details on land use and forest disturbance history. We trained a random forest algorithm and generated high-resolution (30 m) binary forest maps covering ~15 Mha, building on 39 optical (Landsat-8), radar (Sentinel-1) and elevation bands, indices and textures. We validated the quality of the outputs across the studied deforestation gradient and compared them to (a): 3 national land cover maps used for international reporting, (b): 4 global forest datasets (Global Forest Change, Copernicus Land Cover, JAXA and TanDEM-X Forest/Non-Forest). Our method generated highly accurate (92%) forest maps for the studied regions when compared to the global datasets, which generally overestimated forest cover. We achieved accuracies similar to the national maps, following a standardized method for all countries. The difficulties in delineating forest increased in more advanced stages of deforestation, with recurring struggles to distinguish non-forest tree-based systems (e.g. perennials, palms, or agroforestry), shrublands and grasslands. Regrowth forests were repeatedly misclassified across contexts, countries and datasets, in contrast to reference or degraded forests. Our results highlight the importance of in situ verification as accompanying method to establish efficient forest monitoring systems, especially in areas with higher rates of forest cover change and in tropical regions of advanced deforestation or early reforestation stages.

The analysis finds a robust association between trust and deforestation while controlling for other theoretically relevant factors governing forest use, including democracy and economic development. Our results further illustrate how social capital, in this case trust, explains how well society manages its common-pool resources. Since trust arises within voluntary associations and through participation in collective action, one of the policy implications is for national and subnational governments to enable and encourage the formation of groups devoted to forest governance, as well increasing opportunities to participate in shared governance of forests.",NA,NA,"webofscience","trust and deforestation: a cross-country comparison","paper_1513"

Brazil is a hotspot of Protected Area Downgrading, Downsizing, and Degazettement (PADDD) events, with most events associated with infrastructure projects. Despite the threats dams impose on PAs, there is a knowledge gap in assessing deforestation in PAs around large dams in the Amazon. This study investigates how deforestation affects Biodiversity Protection Areas (BioPAs) and Indigenous Lands around the Jirau and Santo Anto nio (JSA) dams (Madeira River, Rondo nia) and Belo Monte dam (Xingu River, Par a) in the Brazilian Amazon. We compared clear-cutting between PAs and control areas and the annual rates of forest change between pre -dam and post -dam periods. We discussed deforestation-related factors (e.g., PADDD events and the presence of management plans or councils). Our results show an increase in deforestation after the operation of the dams when environmental control from licensing agencies decreases and other political and economic factors are in practice. Indigenous Lands experienced a significant increase in deforestation around the Belo Monte dam, which is associated with the demarcation process and land conflicts. Surrounding the JSA dams, sustainable use BioPAs showed high deforestation rates, and 27 PADDD events were reported, four directly related to dams. In addition to dams, deforestation was associated with the crisis of Brazilian democracy and the weakening of environmental policies. In conclusion, the weak environmental control from environmental licensing agencies during dam operation and PADDD events have contributed to increased deforestation rates and additional stresses in the Amazon.",NA,NA,"webofscience","two decades of clear-cutting threats in the brazilian amazonian protected areas around the jirau, santo antonio, and belo monte large dams","paper_1514"

However, it suffers one of the highest rates of forest loss worldwide, mainly due to strong anthropogenic pressures. As Comorian populations depend on forest resources for subsistence, establishing relevant conservation strategies for their sustainable management requires the consideration of multiple stakeholders' perspectives toward biodiversity and habitat conservation. To better understand the relationships between humans and nature; how comorian people use natural resource and the relevance of a protected area for long-term biodiversity conservation, we used Q-methodology to assess local people's perceptions regarding biodiversity and conservation actions. Three discourses are identified during analysis: Pro-environment discourse, Keeping things as usual and Social and environmental concerns. According to the results, employed respondents, were favorable to long-term forest and biodiversity conservation. In contrast, unemployed respondents were in favor of more immediate benefits while unemployed but educated respondents were in favor to both long-term forest conservation and immediate benefits from forests. This suggests that poverty and a lack of access to basic services is associated with overharvesting of natural resources by rural people. These results suggest that biodiversity conservation of the Comoros archipelagos may benefit for plan aiming at (1) developing tourism and maintaining sustainable production of crops and livestock that could allow enhancing livelihoods and well-being of all social groups, (2) developing projects such as local markets that could allow villagers to sell agricultural productions, (3) setting up awareness campaign for tree-planting and reforestation. Reforestation could allow re-establishing natural plants and make large trees available for long-term purposes.",NA,NA,"webofscience","understanding drivers of unsustainable natural resource use in the comoro islands","paper_1523"

Between 2003 and 2011, public audits of federal funds increased deforestation by about 10% in municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon within the first three years after the audit. The audits triggered forest loss, especially during election years, in municipalities governed by first-term mayors who managed to win re-elections afterwards, and in places with a high share of cattle ranching, indicating potential collusion between local politicians and the agricultural sector.",NA,NA,"webofscience","unintended environmental consequences of anti-corruption strategies","paper_1529"

This change was made in response to global discourses that linked forest cover to a modern nation's moral and economic health. Arbor Day coincided with the Tomb-Sweeping Festival, a day traditionally reserved for ancestor worship. Due to the vast climatic disparities within China, many governments planted Arbor Day trees under conditions that made it impossible for them to thrive. Nevertheless, officials throughout China continued to celebrate Arbor Day as proof of their loyalty to the government in Beijing. Arbor Day thus served more as an exercise in promoting national unity than in creating a viable reforestation campaign.",NA,NA,"webofscience","unity in the trees: arbor day and republican china, 1915-1927","paper_1530"

There has been a concerted international effort to develop remote sensing techniques to monitor broad-scale patterns of forest canopy disturbance. In addition to loss of natural resources, recent deforestation in Mesoamerica threatens historic cultural resources that for centuries lay hidden below the protective canopy. Here, we compare satellite-derived measures of canopy disturbance that occurred over a three decade period since 1980 to those derived from a 2009 airborne LiDAR campaign over the Caracol Archaeological Reserve in western Belize. Scaling up fine-resolution canopy height measures to the 30 m resolution of Landsat Thematic Mapper, we found LiDAR revealed a >58% increase in the extent of canopy disturbance where there was an overlap of the remotely sensed data sources. For the entire archaeological reserve, with the addition of LiDAR, there was a 2.5% increase of degraded canopy than estimated with Landsat alone, indicating that 11.3% of the reserve has been subjected to illegal selective logging and deforestation. Incursions into the reserve from the Guatemala border, represented by LiDAR-detected canopy disturbance, extended 1 km deeper (to 3.5 km) into Belize than were derived with Landsat. Thus, while LiDAR enables a synoptic, never-seen-before, below-canopy view of the Maya city of Caracol, it also reveals the degree of canopy disturbance and potential looting of areas yet to be documented by archaeologists on the ground.",NA,NA,"webofscience","use of airborne lidar to delineate canopy degradation and encroachment along the guatemala-belize border","paper_1537"

By including six additional years of research, this article more than doubles the evidence base to 320 spatially explicit econometric studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals from 1996 to 2019. We find that deforestation is consistently associated with greater accessibility (as influenced by natural features such as slope and elevation and built infrastructure such as roads, cities, and cleared areas) and with higher economic returns (from agriculture, livestock, and timber). Some demographic variables are consistently associated with less deforestation (e.g., Indigenous people, poverty, and age) or more deforestation (e.g., population), and others are not associated with the level of deforestation (e.g., education and gender). Policies that directly influence allowable land-use activities are associated with less deforestation (e.g., protected areas, enforcement of forest laws, payments for ecosystem services, community forest management, and certification of sustainable commodities). But policies and institutions that primarily seek other ends are not consistently associated with more or less deforestation (e.g., democracy, general governance, conflict abatement, and land-tenure security). We introduce reforestation and forest degradation as new dependent variables alongside deforestation.

Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5 million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods, diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical developing countries.
