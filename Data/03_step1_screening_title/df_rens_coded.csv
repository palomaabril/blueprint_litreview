In particular, it explores the meaning of its guiding maxim, Minimum Government, Maximum Governance', by analysing specific reforms and broader changes in state-society relations. First, the Modi government has imposed greater discipline in public administration through a personalistic, centralised and technocratic style of rule. But it has bolstered executive power by limiting political transparency, parliamentary government and social dissent. Second, the new government has promoted urbanisation, manufacturing and infrastructure through greater economic liberalisation, public investment and institutional reform. Yet it has weakened many labour protocols, environmental regulations and participatory mechanisms regarding land acquisition and forest conservation. Lastly, the Modi administration has introduced new insurance schemes and championed digitally-enabled cash transfers to deliver social entitlements. However, it has reduced public spending on primary education and basic health, and undercut many rights-based welfare acts introduced by the previous administration, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). These three trends have narrowed the spaces of power and contestation in contemporary Indian democracy, frustrating the promise of maximum governance'.",NA,NA,webofscience,"'minimum government, maximum governance': the restructuring of power in modi's india",paper_7

The convective development during 7 February 1999 is shown to occur during a period of very weak large-scale forcing in the presence of topography and deforestation. The available data include dual Doppler radar analysis, radiosonde launches, and surface and boundary layer observations. The observational analysis is complemented with a series of model simulations using the RAMS with 2-km resolution over a 300 km 300 km area forced by a morning radiosonde profile. A comparison of the observed and simulated thermodynamic transformation of the boundary layer and of the formation of convective lines, and of their kinematic and microphysical properties is presented. It is shown that only a few very deep and intense convective cells are necessary to explain the overall precipitating line formation and that discrete propagation and coupling with upper atmosphere circulations may explain the appearance of several lines. The numerical simulation indicates that topography may be the cause of initial convective development, although later on the convective line is parallel to the midlevel shear. There are indications that small-scale deforestation may have an effect on increasing rainfall in the wet season when the large-scale forcing is very weak.",NA,NA,webofscience,a case study of convective organization into precipitating lines in the southwest amazon during the wetamc and trmm-lba,paper_16

Today this social movement is still alive and kicking. In 2010, the Aru Islands community was taken by surprise by the plan of a private corporation (PT Menara Group or PT MG) to annex forest areas in the Aru Islands in order to convert them into sugar-cane plantations. Their outrage at this plan spurred the citizens of Aru to fight the might of this corporate and preserve their forests and environment. Not all has gone smoothly as the civil society movement in Aru has been divided into pro-splitting and counter-splitting on a regional division agenda. Meanwhile, this exploitative business has become a scourge for the Aru people who want to preserve their forests and the environment as a whole. Thanks to the campaign, environmental awareness appears to be growing rather than abating among the Aru Islands community. Young people in the Aru have been sharing their stories about the natural resources around them under threat from the power of private corporate capital with friends, family, and neighbours. The danger of deforestation by private corporations is a problem and a challenge that must be faced by all communities, whether they be Aru, Indonesian, or international, who care about the preservation of the forests in the Aru Islands as a lung of the world, helping to reduce the effects of global warming and the ozone depletion.",NA,NA,webofscience,a reflection on a peripheral movement the save aru social movement 2013-2015 from a historical perspective,paper_44

Biomass reflects the health and environmental conditions of a forest ecosystem. In context to the climate change mitigation mechanisms like REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an extensive forest monitoring campaign is especially important. Remote sensing of forest structure and biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bears significant potential for mapping and understanding forest ecological processes. Limitations of the conventional forest inventory procedures, like the extensive cost, labor and time, can be overcome through integrated geospatial techniques. Optical sensor or SAR data are suitable for extracting information about simple and homogeneous forest stand sites. However, optical sensors face serious limitations, specifically in tropical regions, like the cloud cover that SAR can overcome along with targeting saturation and penetration aspects. Simultaneous use of spectral information and image texture parameters improves the biomass assessment over undulating terrain and in radical conditions. Also, synergic use of multi-sensor optical and SAR has better potential than single sensor. Interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) SAR or a combination of the both (PolInSAR) serves as effective alternatives. These techniques could serve as valuable methods for biomass assessment of heterogeneous complex biophysical environments. However, SAR data have its own limitations and complexities. Identifying, understanding and solving major uncertainties in different stages of the biomass estimation procedure are critical. In this regard, the current study provides a review of radar remote sensing-based studies in forest biomass estimation.",NA,NA,webofscience,a review of radar remote sensing for biomass estimation,paper_46

Each new observation contributes to the probability of deforestation occurrence, utilizing prior knowledge and a data model. Our method offers the advantage of detecting small-scale deforestation without resorting to spatial filtering techniques, thus preserving the native spatial resolution of the Sentinel-1 measurements. To assess its effectiveness, we conducted comparative evaluations against existing operational deforestation monitoring systems. The validation campaign revealed that our method exhibits enhanced detection performance with low false alarm rates with respect to existing systems across diverse landscapes, including dense forest regions such as the Brazilian Amazon, as well as seasonality-dependent areas like the Cerrado, which is strongly under-monitored by existing technology. This robustness stems from the sequential adaptive process inherent in our approach, which enables effective monitoring even in the presence of backscatter variations.",NA,NA,webofscience,a statistical method for near real-time deforestation monitoring using time series of sentinel-1 images,paper_51

The improved housing efficiency and resilience will contribute to strengthen sanitation and hygiene, improve the living comfort and reduce environmental impact, particularly focusing on preserving the forest biodiversity. The project was developed following the criteria of environmental, technical, social and economic sustainability to propose a shared model, reproducible by the beneficiaries living in different kinds of Mosquitian ecosystems. Increased building efficiency is obtained through optimization of construction techniques and improvement of materials' performances. The main material of the proposed dwelling is wood, coherently with the Miskita tradition; the increase of its durability, which is obtained by proper seasoning and protection from atmospheric agents and parasites, contributes to the optimization of the use of this natural resource and to reducing the impact on deforestation, which threatens forest biodiversity. The data collection campaign, conducted before developing the housing model design and which has aimed at obtaining information on technical and social aspects related to residences' welfare and health conditions, has highlighted the great importance of improving the construction model. Despite the advance in sanitary conditions and the economic level, the data collection campaign revealed that even the most developed communities amongst those visited have been perpetrating substantial construction errors, which reduce the resilience of structures to extreme natural phenomena, such as tropical storms and hurricanes, which frequently affect the Mosquitia region. This unexpected discovery increased the importance of housing model design in order to correct these improper construction techniques and avoid their application in the newly-started village growth.",NA,NA,webofscience,a sustainable and resilient housing model for indigenous populations of the mosquitia region (honduras),paper_55

Applying FPIC in this context can ensure that both government and citizen's interests are achieved within the permitted political space.

ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders. ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bio-slurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods. Households perceive higher crop yields (84%-91% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%-94% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%-91% of users). Benefits most appreciated are easy cooking and saving time and money. Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters. The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use.

Emission ratios for aerosol number (CN) relative to CO (ERCN/CO) fell in the range 14-32 cm(-3) ppb(-1) in most of the investigated smoke plumes. Particle number emission ratios have to our knowledge not been previously measured in tropical deforestation fires, but our results are in agreement with values usually found from tropical savanna fires. The number of particles emitted per amount biomass burned was found to be dependent on the fire conditions (combustion efficiency). Variability in ERCN/CO between fires was similar to the variability caused by variations in combustion behavior within each individual fire. This was confirmed by observations of CO-to-CO2 emission ratios (ERCO/CO2), which stretched across the same wide range of values for individual fires as for all the fires observed during the sampling campaign, reflecting the fact that flaming and smoldering phases are present simultaneously in deforestation fires. Emission factors (EF) for CO and aerosol particles were computed and a correction was applied for the residual smoldering combustion (RSC) fraction of emissions that are not sampled by the aircraft, which increased the EF by a factor of 1.5-2.1. Vertical transport of smoke from the boundary layer (BL) to the cloud detrainment layer (CDL) and the free troposphere (FT) was found to be a very common phenomenon. We observed a 20% loss in particle number as a result of this vertical transport and subsequent cloud processing, attributable to in-cloud coagulation. This small loss fraction suggests that this mode of transport is very efficient in terms of particle numbers and occurs mostly via non-precipitating clouds. The detrained aerosol particles released in the CDL and FT were larger than in the unprocessed smoke, mostly due to coagulation and secondary growth, and therefore more efficient at scattering radiation and nucleating cloud droplets. This process may have significant atmospheric implications on a regional and larger scale.",NA,NA,webofscience,airborne measurements of trace gas and aerosol particle emissions from biomass burning in amazonia,paper_85

Although several inventories of biomass burning emissions cover Brazil, there are still considerable uncertainties and differences among them. While most fire emission inventories utilize the parameters of burned area, vegetation fuel load, emission factors, and other parameters to estimate the biomass burned and its associated emissions, several more recent inventories apply an alternative method based on fire radiative power (FRP) observations to estimate the amount of biomass burned and the corresponding emissions of trace gases and aerosols. The Brazilian Biomass Burning Emission Model (3BEM) and the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) are examples of the first, while the Brazilian Biomass Burning Emission Model with FRP assimilation (3BEM_FRP) and the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) are examples of the latter. These four biomass burning emission inventories were used during the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) field campaign. This paper analyzes and inter-compared them, focusing on eight regions in Brazil and the time period of 1 September-31 October 2012. Aerosol optical thickness (AOT(550aEuro-nm)) derived from measurements made by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operating on board the Terra and Aqua satellites is also applied to assess the inventories' consistency. The daily area-averaged pyrogenic carbon monoxide (CO) emission estimates exhibit significant linear correlations (r, paEuro- > aEuro-0.05 level, Student t test) between 3BEM and FINN and between 3BEM_ FRP and GFAS, with values of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively. These results indicate that emission estimates in this region derived via similar methods tend to agree with one other. However, they differ more from the estimates derived via the alternative approach. The evaluation of MODIS AOT(550aEuro-nm) indicates that model simulation driven by 3BEM and FINN typically underestimate the smoke particle loading in the eastern region of Amazon forest, while 3BEM_FRP estimations to the area tend to overestimate fire emissions. The daily regional CO emission fluxes from 3BEM and FINN have linear correlation coefficients of 0.75-0.92, with typically 20-30aEuro-% higher emission fluxes in FINN. The daily regional CO emission fluxes from 3BEM_FRP and GFAS show linear correlation coefficients between 0.82 and 0.90, with a particularly strong correlation near the arc of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In this region, GFAS has a tendency to present higher CO emissions than 3BEM_FRP, while 3BEM_FRP yields more emissions in the area of soybean expansion east of the Amazon forest. Atmospheric aerosol optical thickness is simulated by using the emission inventories with two operational atmospheric chemistry transport models: the IFS from Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) and the Coupled Aerosol and Tracer Transport model to the Brazilian developments on the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (CCATT-BRAMS). Evaluation against MODIS observations shows a good representation of the general patterns of the AOT(550aEuro-nm) time series. However, the aerosol emissions from fires with particularly high biomass consumption still lead to an underestimation of the atmospheric aerosol load in both models.",NA,NA,webofscience,assessment of fire emission inventories during the south american biomass burning analysis (sambba) experiment,paper_144

Here we systematically catalog whether second-tier governments in 30 tropical countries with high projected future emissions from deforestation possess 14 distinct types of general and forest-related authority. We compile this information in a free, open-access database. Second-tier governments have broadest authority to reduce deforestation in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Peru, China, Laos, Mozambique, and Vietnam. Second-tier governments have the least authority in Central African Republic, Gabon, Angola, Madagascar, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Venezuela. Second-tier governments have intermediate authority in Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Mexico, the Philippines, Colombia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Zambia, Mexico, and Republic of Congo. Authorities that second-tier governments most commonly possess include development planning, taxation, budgeting, and roads. Authorities that second-tier governments least commonly possess include land ownership, police, permits for mining, Indigenous affairs, and protected areas. Authorities possessed by an intermediate number of second-tier governments include spatial planning, elections, courts, and permits for agriculture. More than one-quarter of future emissions from deforestation between 2020 and 2050 is projected to come from just seven out of 678 second-tier jurisdictions: Amazonas, Para, and Mato Grosso (Brazil), equateur and Orientale (Democratic Republic of Congo), Loreto (Peru), and El Beni (Bolivia). After weighting for authority, our list of the 50 second-tier jurisdictions in the tropics that are the highest priority for reducing emissions from deforestation shifts to include fewer second-tier jurisdictions in Africa (where second-tier governments have 4.2 authorities out of 14 in the average country) and Latin America (6.3 authorities out of 14) and more second-tier jurisdictions in Asia (8.5 authorities out of 14). Second-tier jurisdictions that have formally expressed interest in reducing emissions from deforestation, e.g., through the Governors' Climate and Forest Task Force, Under2 Coalition, or New York Declaration on Forests, possess greater authority to reduce deforestation on average than other jurisdictions. Information on second-tier governmental authority, when complemented with deeper country-specific knowledge, can help initiatives for reducing emissions from deforestation (REDD+) prioritize support across regions and across sectoral interventions.",NA,NA,webofscience,authority of second-tier governments to reduce deforestation in 30 tropical countries,paper_159

The park was established in 1992 in the context of South Africa's transition to democracy, growing ecotourism in the country and global movements towards conservation involving and benefiting local people. The paper argues that the protracted conflict between park residents and management led to new patterns of livelihood activities and household formation, and resulted in material and social differentiation amongst park households. The goals of park management, with a commitment to nature conservation and ecotourism, were at odds with the livelihood practices of park residents. Conflicts arose over stocking levels, overgrazing, wood-cutting and deforestation and over the use of other natural resources, including water and medicinal plants. The park was the site of a Rand Water project that employed many residents. Residents found themselves between a rock and a hard place as they resisted attempts by the management to reduce stocking levels and yet relied on management to gain access to sources of paid employment.",NA,NA,webofscience,"between a rock and a hard place: contested livelihoods in qwaqwa national park, south africa",paper_172

This article focuses on the local institutions chosen as partners by a prominent REDD+ project in Kenya and the implications of this choice for local democracy. The REDD+ project briefly partnered with state-appointed local authorities to represent local interests, bypassing elected ones. Shortly after, the state-appointed authorities were abandoned in favour of 'project-created' carbon committees and civil society organisations. The choice to recognise some institutions while excluding others, was justified by the levels of downward accountability and of corruption, and arguments that state-sanctioned institutions were overburdened and inefficient. However, the article contends that this preference for carbon committees and civil society organisations over state-sanctioned institutions, and particularly the aversion to democratically elected ones, was not conducive for long-term strengthening of local democracy. The analysis pinpoints a tension between setting up parallel models of authority that can act as exemplars of democratic practice, while undermining democratically elected institutions that, in Kenya, are struggling to exercise newly devolved powers. Explicit strategies are required to enable learning from parallel governance models and for their migration into mainstream local governance structures, if local democracy is to be strengthened rather than undermined.",NA,NA,webofscience,choices have consequences: redd plus and local democracy in kenya,paper_246

To achieve this, the land cover of this protected area was determined by classifying satellite images obtained before, during and after the conflicts, and via ground surveys. Metrics of landscape ecology were calculated. A ground campaign for observing the CFHS's flora and damages incurred was carried out using a sampling of eighteen 500 m-long transects. The results show that forest fragmentation intensified during and after the period of conflicts. Forests covered over 93% of the CFHS's area before conflicts and under 28% in 2015. The main cause of this deforestation is cacao growing. Anthropic activities caused the loss of 40% of plant species, including some which are endemic in Ivory Coast. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In September 2019, the Ivorian and Ghanaian governments imposed the Living Income Differential (LID) on private companies, an additional $ 400 per ton compared to the international market price, passed on to the producer price (farm gate price). At the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 arose. In this dual context, how did prices change? Has the hope of increased income been achieved? Three approaches are used: a) monitoring of the selling price of cocoa beans and monitoring of the price of purchased cocoa farming inputs and basic necessities for households; b) monthly monitoring of farm gate cocoa price in 2020-2021; c) an analysis of national production data from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, the world price, variations in the demand for beans by the grinding industry, and the price paid to producers, over 20 years. The first result is a very temporary and limited rise in the farm gate price of cocoa at the end of 2020, then its fall in 2021 as the price of inputs and basic necessities soar. The 2021-2022 campaign is even more harmful with a tightening of the price scissor. It is therefore the failure of the LID, but the role of Covid-19 in this failure is very nuanced with regard to the declarations of the State and the multinationals. The drop in prices and the loss of income for cocoa farmers in 2020-2022 rather fits into the economic theory of games. Without control of their supply, an agreement between two companies or countries cannot work. The failure is part of a largely endogenous structural change: demographic growth, policies to encourage migration and deforestation, opacity of the sector and finally continued growth of the supply of cocoa from Cote d'Ivoire on the international market.",NA,NA,webofscience,"covid-19, living income differential and decline in income of cocoa producers in cote d'ivoire",paper_320

Public investment in forest conservation and wildfire prevention is crucial, and public support is necessary. In this study, we explore the adequacy of two citizen engagement mechanisms to help in the prevention of wildfires. We design a preference elicitation survey to study preferences for forests and voluntary contributions towards a fire prevention programme, either through voluntary monetary contributions (crowdfunding the prevention expenses) or by contributing with time (crowdsourcing the execution of prevention tasks). We posit that individuals who value forests and forest fire prevention may be willing to contribute directly in either way. We observe that the elicited willingness to participate in either form is high and that while some individual characteristics have an impact on elicited amounts, forest-related variables have no explanatory power. Additionally, respondents who prefer time contributions contribute relatively more time than those who prefer money contributions, who in turn contribute relatively more monetarily, which suggests that using targeted mechanisms for public involvement can optimise overall contributions to forest fire prevention. Furthermore, when comparing time and monetary contributions, as well as accounting for the cost of labour in Portugal, a crowdsourcing campaign would raise more work time than would a crowdfunding campaign to cover the cost of hiring workers to perform these activities.",NA,NA,webofscience,crowdfunding or crowdsourcing time: exploring the willingness of private citizens to help prevent forest fires,paper_325

How paddy fields evolve under human disturbances remains poorly understood, which is critical for land use planning to compromise agricultural production and ecosystem conservation as limited land resource is available. In this study, the spatial and temporal patterns of change in paddy fields were depicted and principal driving forces were explained. Mapping of paddy fields with LANDSAT satellite images reveals a constant declining trend by 14.3% in the period 1990-2015. The gross loss area is 903.3 km(2), with an annual average decreasing rate being 36.1 km(2)center dot yr(-1). The transformation matrix between paddy fields and other land uses explicitly explains the impact trajectories of multiple human activities. Specifically, 39.6% (408.1 km(2)) of the gross loss was converted to built-up lands, reflecting town translocation and human resettlement (involuntary population migration) proposed by construction of the Three Gorges Dam, as well as urbanization, industrial development and infrastructure expansion along with economic development. The area converted to forests accounts for 26.4% (238.2 km(2)), which could be ascribed to land abandonment and the reforestation campaign. 23.1% (208.7 km(2)) was converted to dry croplands by shifts in farmers' preference on crop selection following socioeconomic changes (e.g., voluntary rural population migration, land use policy adjustment, commercial farming enterprises expansion). 46.5 km(2) was converted to water bodies, indicating the effect of impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir.",NA,NA,webofscience,"decadal loss of paddy fields driven by cumulative human activities in the three gorges reservoir area, china",paper_329

Landholdings tended to remain in compliance or not according to their status at the beginning of the study period. The perceived economic burden of BFC compliance on soya bean and beef producers (US$3-5.6 billion in net present value of the land) may in part explain the massive, successful campaign launched by the farm lobby to change the BFC. The ecological benefits of compliance (e. g. greater connectivity and carbon) with the BFC are diffuse and do not compete effectively with the economic benefits of non-compliance that are perceived by landholders. Volatile regulation of land-use decisions that affect billions in economic rent that could be captured is an inadequate forest governance instrument; effectiveness of such regulations may increase when implemented in tandem with positive incentives for forest conservation.",NA,NA,webofscience,"defending public interests in private lands: compliance, costs and potential environmental consequences of the brazilian forest code in mato grosso",paper_340

The basin has three main land covers: native forest, disturbed areas (mainly pasture and agriculture), and water. The results show there was proportional and inverse behavior in relation to native forest and disturbed areas. Thus, there was a reduction of the native forest and an increase in disturbed areas, from 1985 to 2005, but the opposite situation from 2005 to 2015. These results are related to the advancement of colonization in the first period, and to the actions derived from 'Save the River Bamburro' campaign in the second period, in which some areas of riparian forests were recovered.

A theory of deliberate policy disproportionality is used to analyse 20 years of regulatory reform in Queensland, focusing on the Vegetation Management Act (VMA) 1999. Application of the framework to this case suggests that political executives were prone to deliberately adopt (dis)proportionate policies as a strategic response to either manage or capitalise on stakeholder support or opposition to any proposed legislative change. The high variance in (dis)proportionate deforestation policies is attributed to how political executives respond to claims made by competing constituencies regarding the costs versus benefits of successive reforms. During key reform phases, policy under-reaction was the norm, and political executives intentionally limited the scope and effectiveness of the VMA 1999 due to perceived impacts on the agricultural sector. Political executives were highly responsive to the emotional investment of rural constituents and averse to introducing policies that required difficult trade-offs. Elections offered strategic opportunities for delivering more proportionate policies that balanced public environmental benefits with economic impacts, as evidenced by a conditional deforestation ban introduced between 2004 and 2012 and reinstated in 2018. Points for practitionersVariance in Queensland's deforestation policy over time can be attributed to the intentional decisions by political executives to limit or expand the scope of regulations as a strategic response to stakeholder expectations.Political executives were responsive to the costs versus environmental impacts/benefits of any deforestation reforms, but prone to policy under-reaction when the priority was managing the emotive reactions from rural constituencies.More proportionate regulations, such as the partial deforestation ban of 2004, aimed to balance environmental benefits with compensation for landholders but were only implemented when electorally beneficial.Stakeholders have a significant influence on disproportionate deforestation policy design and governments will need to manage competing claims to deliver more durable policy outcomes.",NA,NA,webofscience,"deliberate disproportionate policy outcomes and regulating deforestation in queensland, australia",paper_424

Two dominant hypotheses explain this process. First, according to the hamburger connection beef markets promote conversion of forests into cattle ranches resulting in deforestation. Second, the land-as-wealth hypothesis explains deforestation as the result of land appreciation in forest frontiers. We tested these hypotheses using land use and socioeconomic data from northwestern Amazonia from 2000 to 2009. We also investigated two key control variables: coca cultivation and eradication, both of which have been proposed as important drivers of forest loss. We found high rate of conversion from forest to pasture, and unimpeded forest fragmentation. As predicted by the hamburger connection, pastures expanded as the cattle inventory grew. Beef demand did not drive pasture expansion, as ranching revenues declined and beef prices were roughly stable. Coca cultivation did not respond to the eradication campaign, and declined as the population became increasingly urbanized. We propose that investment on roads has enhanced the anticipated value of land. Cattle bolster land claims and can be used as financial collateral, so they have inherent value even without market exchange. Cattle can then increase despite stable beef prices and declining ranching revenues. To protect biodiversity, policy interventions that enhance the value of standing forests are needed to slow deforestation and fragmentation in these rapidly changing landscapes.

We recreate the data and analyses from that paper on the impact of democracy on deforestation from 1990 through 2000 with great precision before extending the data set and analyses to include the period from 2000 through 2010. We find that the original results of Buitenzorgy and Mol (2011) were spurious and inconsistent in the replication once heteroskedasticity robust standard errors were employed. When combining the two time periods and running analyses on panel data and differenced data for robust outcomes and better policy inferences, we find different results for the effect of democracy on deforestation, indicating that model specification is critical to studying this relationship. The more econometrically sound method, the differenced models, reject the Environmental Kuznet's Curve (EKC) hypothesis for democracy and deforestation, instead indicating that democracy decreased deforestation rates. When adding democracy spillover effects to the model, i.e., the impact on deforestation rates due to changes in democracy levels in neighboring countries, we still find that democracy leads to decreased rates of deforestation. We also find that having more democratic neighbors leads to further decreases in democracy. These outcomes have far-reaching implications for the blocs examined, which are highlighted in this study.",NA,NA,webofscience,democracy and deforestation: the role of spillover effects,paper_430

Empirical evidence thus far has been limited and conflicting. This article seeks to address the democracy-environment debate. We focus on the effect of political regime type on human activities that directly damage the environment. Our discussion of the theoretical literature identifies different causal mechanisms through which democracy could affect environmental degradation. The empirical analysis focuses on the net effect of these competing mechanisms. We examine statistically the effect of democracy on five aspects of human-induced environmental degradation-carbon dioxide emissions, nitrogen dioxide emissions, deforestation, land degradation, and organic pollution in water. We find that democracy reduces all five types of environmental degradation. While the substantive effect of democracy is considerable, it varies in size across different types of environmental degradation.

Very prominent among the myriad factors at play is the political environment within these tropical countries. This study therefore investigates to what extent the rate of tropical deforestation is exacerbated by the democratic/non-democratic nature of the governments in power. We construct a democracy index variable for fifty-five countries across the four regions of the tropical world. The average annual deforestation from 1981-85, is compared to the democracy index variable. We find a strong negative correlation between the level of democracy and the rate of tropical forest exploitation. The global policy implications of this finding are outlined.

Democratic less-developed countries caused 55%-74% of the net global forest area decrease and non-democratic less-developed countries caused 66%-67% of the net forest increase. When the relative forest area change weighted with forest area in the country was plotted against the level of democracy in 121-131 less-developed countries the slopes of fitted linear regressions were statistically significant for all three democracy indices, linking positive forest area change and non-democracy.

By using deforestation rates as a proxy for environmental disruption, we suggest that both sides might be right. Our quantitative analysis has three important outcomes. First, there is evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between deforestation and democracy. Second, countries in democratic transition experience the highest deforestation rates, compared to non-democracies and mature democracies. Third, in explaining deforestation rates democracy has larger explanatory power than income. This last result implies that in reducing deforestation rates the emphasis should not only be on economic development but even more on democratization.",NA,NA,webofscience,does democracy lead to a better environment? deforestation and the democratic transition peak,paper_490

On the other hand, research is also concerned with how deforestation drives people out of rural areas, leading to overurbanization. From this work, it is clear that the movement of people has an important relationship to forest loss, but it is less clear what the autonomy of people is in this process. Put differently, more focus has been put on state-level economic and environmental factors than political factors when considering the impact of domestic migration on forest loss. Although there has been substantial work on how political factors, like democracy, impact forest loss, there is less research on how political rights, like freedom of domestic movement, may impact forest loss. To build on this research, we test the impact of freedom of domestic movement and democracy on forest loss from 2001 to 2014 for a sample of 107 low- and middle-income nations. We find support for the idea that having more freedom of movement decreases forest loss in more democratic nations compared to less democratic nations. We also find that both rural and urban population growth, among others, is associated with higher levels of forest loss. Together, our findings suggest that the freedom of domestic movement should be taken into consideration in addition to population growth from actual domestic movement when researching forest loss.",NA,NA,webofscience,does freedom of domestic movement impact forest loss? a cross-national analysis,paper_494

However, the effectiveness of the afforestation programs and its impacts on vegetation cover and hydrology has not been well studied. This study aims to assess the recent campaigned afforestation program and its impact on vegetation cover and hydrology in the upper Awash basin, Ethiopia. Landsat 8 images of 2013-2020 years were used to calculate the NDVI for the upper Awash basin to assess trends in vegetation greenness for the basin. Moreover, observed streamflow and precipitation datasets of the basin were collected and used for assessing the impact of the afforestation on hydrology. The study result showed decreasing NDVI values despite the afforestation programs in the upper Awash basin. This shows either afforestation rate was less than the deforestation rate or the tree plantation campaign was not effective in the basin. In addition, the campaign based tree plantation focused on the number of tree planted not on how many trees are grown. On the other hand, mean annual precipitation and streamflow were generally increased from 2013 to 2020 in the upper Awash basin. Declining NDVI values but increasing mean annual precipitation in the Awash basin indicated that the declining vegetation was attributed to anthropogenic effects. The increasing streamflow during the same time could be due to the increasing mean annual precipitation. Moreover, the decreasing vegetation cover might have contributed for the increasing streamflow through increasing surface runoff and decreasing transpiration. How-ever, further research is required to assess the precise impacts of afforestation on vegetation cover and hydrologic processes. Generally, the study result showed that the focus of afforestation should be on tree growing than on tree plantation alone.",NA,NA,webofscience,"does the recent afforestation program in ethiopia influenced vegetation cover and hydrology? a case study in the upper awash basin, ethiopia",paper_496

Recent studies have shown that soil Hg loss occurs rapidly after deforestation, suggesting that Hg mobility could be related to the massive cation input resulting from biomass burning. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of the first year of slash-and-bum agriculture on soil Hg levels at the regional scale of the Tapajos River, in the state of Para, Brazilian Amazon. A total of 429 soil samples were collected in 26 farms of five riparian communities of the Tapajos basin. In September 2004, soil samples were collected from primary forest sites planned for slash-and-bum cultivation. In August 2005, one year after the initial burning, a second campaign was held and the exact same sites were re-sampled. Our results showed that total Hg levels in soils did not change significantly during the first year following slash-and-bum, suggesting no immediate release of soil Hg at that point in time. However, an early Hg mobility was detected near the surface (0-5 cm), reflected by a significant shift in Hg distribution in soil fractions. Indeed, a transfer of Hg from fine to coarser soil particles was observed, indicating that chemical bonds between Hg and fine particles could have been altered. A correspondence analysis (CA) showed that this process could be linked to a chemical competition caused by cation enrichment The regional dimension of the study highlighted the prevailing importance of soil types in Hg dynamics, as shown by differentiated soil responses following deforestation according to soil texture. Confirming an early Hg mobility and indicating an eventual Hg release out of the soil, our results reinforce the call for the development of more sustainable agricultural practices in the Amazon.

Among the objectives of the initiative was to restore riparian forests on private land across the basin. For a region where the rivers, rainstorms, forest remnants, distances and farms are huge, the challenges were equally large: crossing the biotic and abiotic thresholds of degradation, as well as addressing the lack of technology, know-how, seeds, forest nurseries, trained personnel and roads, and the lack of motivation for restoration. After 6 years, despite the remarkable advances in terms of technical innovation coupled with a broad and effective social involvement, the restored areas represent only a small portion of those aimed for. The still high costs of restoration, the uncertainties of legislation and also the global economy have been strong forces constraining the expansion of restored forests.

Deforestation predictions using those widely applied drivers can underestimate deforestation rates by as much as 50%. We show that years with the highest deforestation rates also correlate with large administrative shifts caused by presidential elections which results in periods of managerial instability associated with episodic inefficiency, leading to weak institutions unable to properly combat illegal deforestation. Although surveillance and regulatory action plans to combat deforestation have held back deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon since 2005, our results suggest that environmental management institutions should be aware such administration shifts set a burden on the policy targets associated with conservation policies. Institutional vulnerability immediately after major elections is an acknowledged fact in Brazil, though it has been mostly disregarded as an indicator of ecological threat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we assessed the runoff generation, flow paths and water source dynamics of a pristine rainforest catchment in Costa Rica using end member mixing analysis (EMMA) and a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR). Geochemical tracer data collected over a 4-week field campaign were combined with tritium data used to assess potential deeper groundwater flow pathways to the perennial stream. The streamflow composition was best captured using three end-members, namely throughfall, shallow (5-15 cm) and deeper (15-50 cm) soil water. We estimated the end-member contributions to the main stream and two tributaries using the two mixing approaches and found good agreement between results obtained from EMMA and MixSIAR. The system was overwhelmingly dominated by near-surface sources, with little evidence for deeper and older groundwater as tritium-derived baseflow mean transit time was between 2.0 and 4.4 years. The shallow soil flow pathway dominated streamflow contributions in the main stream (median 39% and 49% based on EMMA and MixSIAR, respectively), followed by the deeper soil (32% and 31%) and throughfall (25% and 19%). The two tributaries had even greater shallow soil water contributions relative to the main stream (83% and 74% for tributary A and 42% and 63% for tributary B). Tributary B had no detectable deep soil water contribution, reflecting the morphology of the hillslope (steeper slopes, shallower soils and lower vegetation density compared to hillslope A). Despite the short sampling campaign and associated uncertainties, this study allowed to thoroughly assess runoff generation mechanisms in a humid tropical catchment. Our results also provide a first comparison of two increasingly used mixing models and suggest that EMMA and MixSIAR yield comparable estimates of water source partitioning in this tropical, volcanic rainforest environment.",NA,NA,webofscience,end member and bayesian mixing models consistently indicate near-surface flowpath dominance in a pristine humid tropical rainforest,paper_556

Specifically, the paper focuses on the effect of energy justice and democratization. The main contribution to the literature hinges on the emphasis on energy justice - operationalized as rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking - and its interaction with democracy. Using a panel data of 47 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2000-2020 and the dynamic two-step generalized method of moment estimator, the results generally indicate that improvement in rural-urban equality in access to electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking is associated with a reduction in deforestation. Democracy is similarly found to be associated with reduction in deforestation. The conditional effect analysis largely depicts an intensified reducing effect of energy justice on deforestation in the presence of improved democratic practices. The results though robust to an alternative estimator, the Driscoll-Kraay estimator, differ when sub-regional analysis is considered. The paper aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 7, 13, 15 and 16.",NA,NA,webofscience,"energy justice, democracy and deforestation",paper_559

This controversy was sparked by a campaign promoting the legalisation and management of these hitherto informal forests and promising multiple socioeconomic and ecological benefits by developing what we call new forests. Emphasising dormant potential and claiming win-win solutions meant a fundamental discursive shift away from abandoned farmland's negative framing. We conducted a political discourse analysis of media coverage, campaigns, and legislation around new forests from 2013 through 2022. Our approach draws on an analysis of practical argumentation and a Science and Technology Studies (STS)-inspired issue-oriented perspective. We found that the controversy on the future use of this land was one of conflicting visions rather than actual land-use conflicts. Three camps developed, advocating private new forests, state-controlled forestry, and agricultural recultivation. We discuss how the new forest controversy reflects broader rationalities, and tensions between agriculture, forestry, carbon sequestration, and forest conservation that remain relevant even though circumstances for policies of farmland reuse in Russia have changed fundamentally since 2022.",NA,NA,webofscience,envisioning new forests on abandoned farmland in russia: a discourse analysis of a controversy,paper_584

Understanding forest structure proves vital in accurately estimating both forest biomass and also the natural disturbances and remote sensing is an essential method for quantification of forest properties and structure in the tropics. Our objective is to examine canopy vegetation profiles formulated from discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) data and examine their usefulness in estimating forest structural parameters measured during a field campaign. We developed a modeling procedure that utilized hypothetical stand characteristics to examine lidar profiles. In essence, this is a simple method to further enhance shape characteristics from the lidar profile. In this paper we report the results comparing field data collected at La Selva, Costa Rica (10 degrees 26' N, 83 degrees 59' W) and forest structure and parameters calculated from vegetation height profiles and forest structural modeling. We developed multiple regression models for each measured forest biometric property using forward stepwise variable selection that used Bayesian information criteria (BIC) as selection criteria. Among measures of forest structure, ranging from tree lateral density, diameter at breast height, and crown geometry, we found strong relationships with lidar canopy vegetation profile parameters. Metrics developed from lidar that were indicators of height of canopy were not significant in estimating plot biomass (p-value = 0.31, r(2) = 0.17), but parameters from our synthetic forest model were found to be significant for estimating many of the forest structural properties, such as mean trunk diameter (p-value = 0.004, r(2) = 0.51) and tree density (p-value = 0.002, r(2) = 0.43). We were also able to develop a significant model relating lidar profiles to basal area (p-value = 0.003, r(2) = 0.43). Use of the full lidar profile provided additional avenues for the prediction of field based forest measure parameters. Our synthetic canopy model provides a novel method for examining lidar metrics by developing a look-up table of profiles that determine profile shape, depth, and height. We suggest that the use of metrics indicating canopy height derived from lidar are limited in understanding biomass in a forest with little variation across the landscape and that there are many parameters that may be gleaned by lidar data that inform on forest biometric properties.

This article offers an exemplary case of this debate, exploring the theoretical links between democracy and environmental protection advanced by Walker (1999): accountability, development and participation. The site of the study is a Mexican native village, one of many incorporated into the metropolis, Mexico City. The city is faced with the challenge to supply an expanding population of some 20 million with housing, clean water and oxygen. The forest in the common property belonging to the original inhabitants is formally protected with logging bans and a rigorous Land Use Plan, yet illegal sales of this communal land to new settlers result in irregular settlements which now contain one quarter of the village's inhabitants. In 1997 local elections were reinstated in Mexico City, after a suspension of nearly 70 years. Although the governing party in the city promoted the protective Land Use Plan, the party's local politicians promised to regularize the zone in exchange for votes from the irregular settlers. These dynamics are explored in the context of everyday political practices in the village. The struggles over material and symbolic resources are analyzed in terms of force fields with multiple actors, making visible the ways in which democratic elections alone cannot prevent the ongoing deforestation caused by irregular settlements.

Polarimetric interferometric synthetic aperture radar L-band-2 (PiSAR-L2) is a second-generation airborne sensor developed by JAXA. We acquired full-polarimetric data at a fine spatial resolution of 2.5 m during the PiSAR-L2 flight campaign in August 2012. A total of 59 field measurement plots for aboveground forest carbon stocks (AFCSs) were established in same year where AFCS ranged between 4.8 and 253.5 Mg C ha(-1). The plots comprised natural and plantation forests. These plot-level field data were used for calibrating and validating AFCS estimation models with the SAR data. Various possibilities including direct sigma naught backscatters and their ratios and various types of textures obtained from HH, HV, and VV polarizations were examined by applying regression modeling. The main indicators used for the selection of best potential models in the calibration phase were R-2, variable inflation factor (VIF), p-value, and root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs). The potential models were validated using the leave-one-out (LOO) method. The results indicated that a simple combination of backscatters and their ratios provides an AFCS estimate with an RMSE of 42.37 Mg C ha(-1) and an R-2 of 0.65. Inclusion of SAR textural parameters improved the AFCS estimates with an RMSE of 30.93 Mg C ha(-1) and an R-2 of 0.80.

Our objective was to encompass representatives of the nation's major ecological zones and protect the greatest number of species possible. Expansion becomes increasingly difficult once the least controversial sites have received protection, but if Mongolia hopes to achieve its goal of protecting 30% of its territory, it must create additional protected areas, expand existing reserves, increase the types of possible protected areas, and create habitat corridors and buffer zones.

For example, elected local government authorities, who ostensibly represent rural people, are neither present in the UN-REDD board nor were they invited to the participatory forums that vetted the Nigeria-REDD. They were excluded because they were politically weak. However, UN-REDD approved the Nigeria-REDD proposal without a strategy to include or strengthen elected local governments.

Sustainable development in a forest bioeconomy is a system geared towards improving people's socioeconomic and environmental situation through forestry, yet in Ghana, it is neither heard about nor well understood by many people. A good knowledge about the forest bioeconomic system will enhance people to become custodians of the forest ecosystems instead of being destroyers. Field and secondary data were collected and analyzed using IBM SPSS 29.0, CANOCO 5.0, and ArcGIS 10.5. The study showed that larger areas of forest were found in decade 1 (1990-1999) relative to decade 2 (2000-2009) and decade 3 (2010-2020). Forests' contributions to GDP vary between the forest-vegetation belts and regions, decreasing rapidly from 1990 to 2020. Population growth, agricultural activities, and commodity-driven deforestation ranked highest in the list of the drivers of deforestation. A reduction in deforestation might bring about a reduction in carbon emissions; however, the economic repercussions are negative as the contribution of forest to GDP, income, and employment will fall as trade-offs. Findings from the study will significantly help to bring lasting solutions to deforestation and enhance the sustainable forest bioeconomy. The study has unveiled remote drivers of forest loss that have been long overlooked by previous studies. A sustainable enlightenment campaign and routine informal education of the rural people are highly necessary. This is because some of the peoples' reasons for deforestation and preference for forest products compared with modern resources seem convincing and logical.",NA,NA,webofscience,forest bioeconomy in ghana: understanding the potential indicators for its sustainable development,paper_649

They also play a vital role in evaluating forest carbon pools. This study presents a Matern kernel-based Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach for biomass estimation integrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter intensities with LiDAR measurements. We use the backscatter intensities from five scenes of L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) simulated NISAR data collected during the 2019 AM-PM NASA airborne campaign. The biomass map derived from LVIS (Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor) Lidar point clouds over the Lenoir landing site, Alabama, was used with these simulated NISAR data. We have utilized the GPR model to estimate the AGB of the entire forest alongside the major forest classes in the study area, namely deciduous, evergreen, and woody wetlands. To examine the dependency of the model on acquisition conditions, we calibrated and validated our proposed model utilizing scene combinations. The experiment shows that multiple-scene retrieval delivered improved AGB estimates compared to single-scene retrieval. We evaluated the efficacy of the GPR model for three AGB ranges, i.e., (i) 8 to 100 Mg ha-1, (ii) 8 to 230 Mg ha-1, and (iii) 8 to 470 Mg ha-1 at 20 m, 30 m, 50 m and 100 m spatial resolution, respectively. The results indicate that the RMSE incurred by the GPR model for all these AGB ranges seemed to reduce as we increased spatial extent or reduced spatial resolution from 20 m to 100 m. Further, we demonstrate the performance of the optimized GPR model to retrieve AGB within the biomass range of 8 Mg ha-1 to 100 Mg ha-1 for all the above-mentioned forest types. Finally, this research highlights the advantages of the Matern kernel-based GPR model over other statistical regression models towards improved AGB mapping.",NA,NA,webofscience,gaussian process regression-based forest above ground biomass retrieval from simulated l-band nisar data,paper_714

Despite this threat, the nesting trees that support the commonly traded birds in Talakaigan Forest are not well documented. Hence, the study was conducted to provide information on the characteristics, species composition and geographical distribution of nesting trees. The study was participated by the indigenous Tagbanua bird poachers in the area. Preliminary information was obtained using key informant interview and focused group discussion. Appropriate parabiology training was conducted to equip the participants with practical skills needed in the data gathering. The study unfolded that there were only two species of birds commonly poached in the watershed, the Tanygnathus lucionensis and Gracula religiosa. These birds nest only on four species of trees which typically towers above the canopy layer. Remarkably, more than 60% of the recorded nesting trees belong to a single species of tree, the Koompassia excelsa. The GIS analysis unveiled that most nesting trees were located in the interior part of the forest. The skill needed to venture into the jungle highlights the role of Tagbanua Tribesmen in the poaching activity in the area. The study recommends an education campaign, enforcement of relevant environmental laws as well as conservation activities focusing on both the nest trees and the poached bird species to be implemented in the area.",NA,NA,webofscience,"georeferencing and characterization of nesting trees of commonly traded wild birds (blue-naped parrot tanygnathus lucionensis and hill myna gracula religiosa) in talakaigan watershed aborlan, palawan, philippines",paper_718

Deforestation and reclamation of cultivable waste land in the arable lowlands, for the purpose of resettlement through processes of land grants, installing feudal institutions to collect revenues and cover territorial administration and various policy incentives to attract hill people and Indian immigrants to expand settlements and agricultural expanse, all represent the historical processes of land cover change until 1950. The end of the Rana regime, through establishment of democracy, brought reforms in land tenure and abolished anti-peasantry feelings, which consequently attracted hill people to settle in the lowlands of Tarai, Bhawar, and Duns. Following from the eradication of malaria in the 1950s and 1960s, planned resettlement programs and the implementation of development projects attracted people from food-deficit conditions in the hills to the lowlands, causing a large-scale change in the land cover as well as the cultural landscape. Time series land cover maps revealed the predominance of forest in all physiographic units except Tarai in 1954. Forest cover began to decline in the later decades in all physiographic units at the gain of cultivated land. Forest coverage in the hill slopes, inner river valleys, and Duns and Bhawar represented 92, 72, 48, and 79% of the total area in 1954, which reduced to 89, 43, 36, and 64% in 1979. Forest cover in Tarai reduced from 30 to 15% by 1979 over the same period. It further reduced to 85, 24, 29, and 58% respectively in 1994. Only 10% of the area in Tarai was under forest. Compared to 1994, forest coverage decreased to 82, 20, 28, and 54% in the hill slopes, inner river valleys, and Duns and Bhawar respectively, in 2015. It has virtually remained the same in Tarai over the last two decades. Hence the rate of forest decline over the last six decades was high in arable areas of river valleys and Bhawar. The highest rate of deforestation was observed in the west, compared to the east and central part of the Chure-Tarai region. The proportion of shrub/grass areas increased notably in the Chure hill slopes, inner river valleys, and Duns. This implies a degradation of forest, which is a threat to the ecology and stability of such fragile slopes and terrain. Although conversion from forest to cultivated land is a general trend in recent decades, reclamation of forest, shrub, or grass from abandoned or damaged cultivated areas represents quite a significant characteristic of the internal dynamics of land cover change. This is attributable to abandonment of cultivated terraces on marginal hill slopes and damage caused by floods, channel shifts, and bank erosion on low land. Apart from the historical drivers, contemporary drivers of land cover change are demographics, development and increasing physical access and mobility, and urbanization. Illegal settlements on public forest land or encroachment on the land mainly by the landless, poverty stricken, and disaster hit people, as well as political instabilities, a continued dependency on forest resources, over grazing, forest fires, landslides, erosion, and floods are also recognized drivers of change. Forest and land resource degradation, loss or threat to biodiversity, increased landslide and flood disaster, the disruption of river and wetland ecology, and the depletion of ground water resources represent noticeable evidence of the negative consequences of an environment associated with the processes of land cover change.",NA,NA,webofscience,historical land covers change in the chure-tarai landscape in the last six decades: drivers and environmental consequences,paper_761

What explains the emergence of these laws? How are the rights conceived by these acts conceptualized, operationalized and pursued? What are the promises, challenges and risks legal, political and economic of enshrining socioeconomic entitlements as formal statutory rights? This paper engages these questions. In part 1, I argue that three slow-burning processes since the 1980s, distinct yet related, catalyzed India's new rights agenda: high socio-legal activism, rapid uneven development and the expanding popular foundations of its federal parliamentary democracy. Significantly, all three processes exposed the growing nexus between political corruption and socioeconomic inequality. Equally, however, each raised popular expectations for greater social justice that were only partly met. Part 2 of the paper evaluates India's new rights agenda. The promise of these new laws is threefold: they breach the traditional division of civil, political and socioeconomic rights, devise innovative governance mechanisms that enable citizens to see the state and provide fresh incentives for new political coalitions to emerge across state and society. Several risks exist, however. Official political resistance from above and below, the limited capacities of judicial actors, state bureaucracies and social forces and the relatively narrow base of many of these new movements endanger the potential of these reforms.

Most of these emissions are attributed to losses from aboveground terrestrial pools such as deforestation. However, much less is known about the effects of land use change on soil carbon pools at regional scales. To address this problem, relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC), land use/land cover (LULC) classes, and LULC change were investigated at the regional scale. A legacy soil survey was used in conjunction with a new, contemporary sampling campaign to determine SOC change through time. Together, the two datasets cover an approximate 40-year time period (1965 to 2009). The greatest densities of SOC were documented in wetland classes. Specifically, soils of Hardwood Swamp, Cypress Swamp, and Mixed Urban consisted of both residential Wetland Forest contained 9.8, 9.5, and 7.8 g C m(-2). In regard to absolute storage, or SOC stocks, Hardwood Swamp, Pineland, and Urban ranked highest and contained 14.4, 13.3, and 9.9 Tg C, respectively. The effect of LULC change was mixed, and resulted in both gains and losses of SOC at the field scale. At the regional scale, median SOC increased by 16.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Urbanization of natural landscapes resulted in the largest rate of sequestration, which increased SOC by 37.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The largest losses were documented in LULC classes converted from Improved Pasture to Rangeland, which decreased SOC by 8.5 g m(-2) yr(-1). (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Mangroves have been observed in field studies, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to offer some degree of protection from tsunamis and hurricanes. The magnitude of energy reduction strongly depends on three major factors, namely mangrove structures, topography-bathymetric features and wave characteristics. Mangroves are vulnerable and resilient to a variety of coastal disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic. Their vulnerability and resilience depend on the intensity, duration and frequency of the disturbances. Tsunamis and hurricanes are infrequent disturbances of high intensity and short duration. Sea-level rise and mangrove deforestation, on the other hand, are chronic events that evolve gradually over a longer period. A relentless government-community campaign is needed to cultivate awareness and education regarding the vulnerability of mangroves and their invaluable ecological services. Both soft and hard approaches are needed to reduce the adverse impacts of coastal disturbances on humans and mangroves.",NA,NA,webofscience,mangrove forests: protection against and resilience to coastal disturbances,paper_935

In many forested landscapes, the largest impacts of land use on forest structure are driven by forest management activities, which can include invasive species control, prescribed fire, partial harvests (e.g. shelterwood harvests) or overstory removals and clearcuts. Active timber management is often used to achieve forest conservation objectives, but to be used effectively, managers require knowledge of harvest frequency and extent in adjacent forests and at landscape scales. In this paper, we develop a timber harvest mapping workflow using machine learning (XGBoost algorithm) and single campaign airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys for the state of Pennsylvania, USA. We show that harvest type (shelterwood and overstory removals) can be mapped at high accuracy (overall accuracy = 94.9%), including broad age classes defined by the number of years since harvest. Errors of omission (false negatives) were lowest for recent (<10 yr old) overstory removal harvests (1.5%) and highest for older (10-18 yr old) shelterwood harvests (34.9%), which is consistent with the expectation that older, partial timber harvests are more difficult to distinguish from untreated forests than are recent harvests. Errors of commission (false positives) were low (<6.0%) for all timber harvest types and ages. Analysis of model results across both public and private lands in three highly forested conservation regions of Pennsylvania (the Poconos, PA Wilds, and Laurel Highlands) revealed a propensity for young overstory removals along forest edges, suggesting edge effects from inaccuracies in the underlying forest mask and mixed pixels contribute to errors of commission. Acknowledging this, overstory removal and shelterwood harvests were roughly equally common across public and private lands when expressed as a fraction of all interior forests (forests >30 m from an edge). The expectation that these harvest treatments would be rarer in private forests was not supported by the model results, which is likely due to the model's inability to distinguish between alternative natural processes (weather damage, wildfire, pathogens, etc.) and forest treatment types (high-grading and firewood collection) that result in similar forest structures to the trained classes in the XGBoost model. This study provides a framework and validation for combining approachable machine-learning techniques with large-campaign LiDAR to accurately predict forest structure with application to a host of forestry, natural resource, and conservation-related problems. Future efforts that refine the model's ability to better distinguish between more complex harvest classes and natural processes would be valuable.",NA,NA,webofscience,mapping recent timber harvest activity in a temperate forest using single date airborne lidar surveys and machine learning: lessons for conservation planning,paper_943

Meso-scale models were run in 1-D and 3-D mode for the area of Rondonia State, Brazil. The important conclusions are that without calibration it is difficult to model the energy partitioning of pasture; modelling that of forest is easier due to the absence of a strong moisture deficit signal. The simulation of the boundary layer above forest is good, above deforested areas (pasture) poor. The models' underestimate of the temperature of the boundary layer is likely to be caused by the neglect of the radiative effects of aerosols caused by biomass burning, but other factors such as lack of sufficient entrainment in the model at the mixed layer top may also contribute. The Andes generate patterns of subsidence and gravity waves, the effects of which are felt far into the Rondonian area. The results show that the picture presented by GCM modelling studies may need to be balanced by an increased understanding of what happens at the meso-scale. The results are used to identify key measurements for the LBA atmospheric meso-scale campaign needed to improve the model simulations.

To determine if forest-related policy demonstrates a paradigm shift toward forest protection, we identify and code a set of 218 national forest-related policy documents passed between 1999 and 2016. We determine whether a paradigmatic change in forest-related policy occurred and the mechanism by which change has or has not taken place through the interpretation of policy citation networks and statistical analysis of temporal relationships between forest related policy content and change over time. We find that there was a significant increase in the amount of Indonesian forest-related policy from 1999 to 2016 and that it was largely comprised of content that promotes forest protection and redefines the structure and funding for forest-related organizations. These content changes primarily occurred through the process of policy layering, when new policy does not amend or repeal old policy and regulation. We discuss current trends in the regulation of forest territory and flow in Indonesia and find further evidence of policy layering. Thus, although Indonesian forest-related policy demonstrates a paradigm shift, the layering process through which new policy was created allows for interpretable flexibility, which enables continued forest cover loss.",NA,NA,webofscience,paradigm shift and business as usual through policy layering: forest-related policy change in indonesia (1999-2016),paper_1023

Combined with cloud-based computing resources, and data collection through the crowd, these solutions have substantially improved possibilities for monitoring changes in land resources, especially in areas with difficult accessibility and data scarcity. In this study, we developed and tested a participatory mapping methodology utilizing the open data catalogues and cloud computing capacity to map the previously unknown extent and species composition of forest plantations in the Southern Highlands area of Tanzania, a region experiencing a rapid growth of smallholder-owned woodlots. A large set of reference data, focusing on forest plantation coverage, species and age information distribution, was collected in a two-week participatory GIS campaign where 22 Tanzanian experts interpreted very high-resolution satellite images in Google Earth with the Open Foris Collect Earth tool developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The collected samples were used as training data to classify a multi-sensor image stack of Landsat 8 (2013-2015), Sentinel-2 (2015-2016), Sentinel-1 (2015), and SRTM derived elevation and slope data layers into a 30 m resolution forest plantation map in Google Earth Engine. The results show that the forest plantation area was estimated with high overall accuracy (85%). The interpretation accuracy of local experts was high considering general definition of forest plantation declining with increased details in interpretation attributes. The results showcase the unique value of local expert participation, enabling the collection of thousands of reference samples over a large geographical area in a short period of time simultaneously building the capacity of the experts. However, sufficient training prior to the data collection is crucial for the interpretation success especially when detailed interpretation is conducted in complex landscapes. Since the methodology is built on open-access data and software, it presents a highly feasible solution for repetitive land resource mapping applicable at different spatial scales globally.",NA,NA,webofscience,participatory mapping of forest plantations with open foris and google earth engine,paper_1027

Soil physicochemical characteristics in the mangroves have an intrinsic relationship with the vegetation. In Brazil, studies seeking to evaluate this relationship are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the soil physicochemical composition in the tree species in the mangrove of the Maracaipe river estuary, Ipojuca/PE, Brazil, by means of physicochemical analyzes of the soil in the species Rizhophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, Avicennia schaueriana and Conocarpus erectus. The species showed physicochemical characteristics different from those found in other studies regarding temperature, since the milder areas were the ones of R. mangle instead of A. schaueriana. Salinity does not appear to be a limiting factor in R. mangle, which showed greater adaptation to salinity variations, while to the species A. schaueriana, it seems to influence its distribution. The concentration of magnesium, sodium, calcium and potassium, arriving to the ecosystem by the tides, indicates the strong marine influence in the Maracaipe river estuary. The source of sediments with predominantly sandy characteristic for the estuary may be related to the deforestation of adjacent mangroves, sandbanks and vegetation. Greater rain contribution in the first campaign imposed changes in macronutrient concentrations in the species L. racemosa, A. schaueriana and C. erectus, which did not occur in R. mangle, which maintained the same pattern in both analyzed periods.",NA,NA,webofscience,physicochemical soil composition in tree species of mangrove ecosystem,paper_1042

This paper explores cases in Los Rios, Chile, to understand how local people living in and near three PPAs viewed impacts of tourism development on human well-being and local governance asking: (1) Why and how do governing PPA actors engage local people in conservation and ecotourism? (2) How do local people perceive the impacts of PPAs? (3) How do perceived impacts differ between PPA ownership types and contexts? We used an Opportunities, Security and Empowerment research framework derived from local definitions of well-being. Results suggest that governing PPA actors (PPA administrations and Chilean government officials) viewed local people as threats to forest conservation goals, embraced exclusion from reserve governance, but encouraged self-governance among local people through educational campaigns promoting environmental stewardship and ecotourism entrepreneurship. PPA administrations avoided emerging participatory democracy approaches to ensure local resistance did not threaten their authority. Despite asymmetrical power relations, PPA-community partnerships were viewed locally as both improving and damaging well-being. Our findings suggest that the social impacts and consequences of PPAs facilitating ecotourism development should be subjected to the same level of scrutiny that has been given to public protected areas.",NA,NA,webofscience,"private protected areas, ecotourism development and impacts on local people's well-being: a review from case studies in southern chile",paper_1082

How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario(1-6). We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends(7,8), the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy-savannah-prone-dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the model democracy view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.",NA,NA,webofscience,projected strengthening of amazonian dry season by constrained climate model simulations,paper_1085

The panel so declined by engaging in a pedantic exercise of dictionary jurisprudence in interpreting the SPS Agreement, misreading the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and undermining a principle of international environmental law that has been resoundingly re-affirmed by the majority of nations. Although the work of the WTO has generated several studies attempting linkages with titles such as Trade and . . . , it is submitted that when it comes to the environment, this emphasis puts the cart before the horse and the real issue should be The Environment and Trade instead of the other way around. Human survival depends on a sustainable environment. The WTO Agreement itself recognizes in its preamble that trade is a means to achieve higher societal aims such as general welfare, sustainable development and the optimal use of the world's resources. By green-lighting the export of GM Foods and subjecting restrictions on imports to the high level scrutiny of the SPS Agreement, the Panel ignored the legitimate concerns of significant stakeholder groups, delegitimized the precautionary principle, and elevated trade liberalization dogma over more general human welfare. Given the narrow focus of the Panel's remit under the SPS Agreement, it is undesirable that the final pronouncement of the status and application of the precautionary principle in international law should be left to a trade liberalization agenda-driven panel that lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many countries and stakeholders as well as democratic accountability. The global community, alarmed by credible reports of global warming, deforestation, overfishing, and other extreme forms of environmental degradation, has a right to an authoritative pronouncement on the status of the precautionary principle in international environmental law. This it could secure if the LW General Assembly, representing the nations of the world, were to ask the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the status of the precautionary principle in customary international law. The pronouncement of the Court, consisting of eminent jurists representing a broad spectrum of nations, would provide the much needed guidance on a subject that relates to human survival.",NA,NA,webofscience,"promoting global food democracy - gm foods, trade law, the environment & ethics",paper_1087

Characterizing these properties usually requires long-term data, precluding characterization of rapid vegetation changes such as those increasingly occurring in the Anthropocene. Consequently, the characterization of rapid events is limited and only possible in a few specific areas. We use a campaign approach to characterize surface properties associated with vegetation structure. In our approach, a profiling LiDAR and hemispherical image analyses quantify vegetation structure and a portable mast instrumented with a net radiometer, wind-humidity-temperature stations in a vertical profile, and soil temperature-heat flux characterize surface properties. We illustrate the application of our approach in two forest types (boreal and semiarid) with disturbance-induced tree loss. Our prototype characterizes major structural changes associated with tree loss, changes in vertical wind profiles, surface roughness energy balance partitioning, a proxy for NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index), and albedo. Multi-day albedo estimates, which differed between control and disturbed areas, were similar to tower-based multiyear characterizations, highlighting the utility and potential of the campaign approach. Our prototype provides general characterization of surface and boundary-layer properties relevant for land surface models, strategically enabling preliminary characterization of rapid vegetation disturbance events.",NA,NA,webofscience,prototype campaign assessment of disturbance-induced tree loss effects on surface properties for atmospheric modeling,paper_1096

Australia's tropical savannas occupy the northern quarter of the continent, a region of increasing interest for further exploitation of land and water resources. Land use decisions across this vast biome have the potential to influence the national greenhouse gas budget. To better quantify emissions from savanna deforestation and investigate the impact of deforestation on national GHG emissions, we undertook a paired site measurement campaign where emissions were quantified from two tropical savanna woodland sites; one that was deforested and prepared for agricultural land use and a second analogue site that remained uncleared for the duration of a 22-month campaign. At both sites, net ecosystem exchange of CO2 was measured using the eddy covariance method. Observations at the deforested site were continuous before, during and after the clearing event, providing high-resolution data that tracked CO2 emissions through nine phases of land use change. At the deforested site, post-clearing debris was allowed to cure for 6 months and was subsequently burnt, followed by extensive soil preparation for cropping. During the debris burning, fluxes of CO2 as measured by the eddy covariance tower were excluded. For this phase, emissions were estimated by quantifying on-site biomass prior to deforestation and applying savanna-specific emission factors to estimate a fire-derived GHG emission that included both CO2 and non-CO2 gases. The total fuel mass that was consumed during the debris burning was 40.9 Mg C ha(-1) and included above-and below-ground woody biomass, course woody debris, twigs, leaf litter and C-4 grass fuels. Emissions from the burning were added to the net CO2 fluxes as measured by the eddy covariance tower for other post deforestation phases to provide a total GHG emission from this land use change. The total emission from this savanna woodland was 148.3 Mg CO2-e ha(-1) with the debris burning responsible for 121.9 Mg CO2-e ha(-1) or 82 % of the total emission. The remaining emission was attributed to CO2 efflux from soil disturbance during site preparation for agriculture (10 % of the total emission) and decay of debris during the curing period prior to burning (8 %). Over the same period, fluxes at the uncleared savanna woodland site were measured using a second flux tower and over the 22-month observation period, cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was a net carbon sink of 2.1 Mg C ha(-1), or 7.7 Mg CO2-e ha(-1). Estimated emissions for this savanna type were then extrapolated to a regional-scale to (1) provide estimates of the magnitude of GHG emissions from any future deforestation and (2) compare them with GHG emissions from prescribed savanna burning that occurs across the northern Australian savanna every year. Emissions from current rate of annual savanna deforestation across northern Australia was double that of reported (non-CO2 only) savanna burning. However, if the total GHG emission, CO2 plus non-CO2 emissions, is accounted for, burning emissions are an order of magnitude larger than that arising from savanna deforestation. We examined a scenario of expanded land use that required additional deforestation of savanna woodlands over and above current rates. This analysis suggested that significant expansion of deforestation area across the northern savanna woodlands could add an additional 3 % to Australia's national GHG account for the duration of the land use change. This bottom-up study provides data that can reduce uncertainty associated with land use change for this extensive tropical ecosystem and provide an assessment of the relative magnitude of GHG emissions from savanna burning and deforestation. Such knowledge can contribute to informing land use decision making processes associated with land and water resource development.",NA,NA,webofscience,quantifying the relative importance of greenhouse gas emissions from current and future savanna land use change across northern australia,paper_1117

Even when policies appear fair, the rural poor face severe biases in implementation. In addition, the poor must compete on an uneven playing field of class, ethnic and other social inequities and economic hurdles. With the development of the global forest (carbon) conservation strategy such as Reduced Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation (REDD), which is ushering in accelerated forest commodification, poor people living in forests risk further marginalisation, exclusion and rights abuses. This article examines how forestry policy and implementation maintain double standards on this uneven playing field in a manner that continues to exclude the rural poor from the natural wealth around them. Poverty is not just about being left out of economic growth. It is produced by the very policies that enable some to profit - today from timber, firewood and charcoal, tomorrow from carbon. For REDD interventions to support poverty alleviation, forestry policies must be radically reworked to counterbalance widespread regressive policies and structural asymmetries. To make forestry policy emancipatory, strong social protections or safeguards are still needed that require REDD and other interventions to support and work through local democratic institutions. Otherwise these policies will continue their regressive trends.",NA,NA,webofscience,reducing redd risks: affirmative policy on an uneven playing field,paper_1147

The elasticity estimates certify the validity of the EKC hypothesis for all the three indicators of deforestation used in this paper: forest area coverage, deforestation rate and net forest depletion rate. Moreover, controlling for democracy lowers the threshold level of growth beyond which the marginal impact of growth results in environmental betterment by reducing the deforestation propensities in Bangladesh. Moreover, democracy and economic growth are also seen to exert a combined impact on the growth-deforestation nexus. The estimated growth thresholds are above the current real GDP level of Bangladesh which reasons the nation's deforestation woes.

Mining is both the major cause of deforestation and the main economic activity in the country. A simple model of the incentives to hold mining property rights is developed and tested using a unique data-set of small-scale mining property rights data. Econometric techniques are used to test the findings of the model, concluding that the number of mining rights issued fall after election years, with the number rescinded rising. The introduction of REDD+ in Guyana also seems to have increased the number of mining claims being relinquished, and reduce the number being issued. The findings highlight the importance of political economy events in the evolution of small-scale mining activity, and show some evidence that the introduction of a REDD+ framework in Guyana has impacted the main driver of deforestation, despite the absence of specific policy targeting the sector.

The presented analysis demonstrates the use of satellite observations for interpreting the effects of deforestation and climate on past and future emissions of CO. The study exploits the MOPITT multispectral retrieval product which effectively resolves tropospheric CO into two independently measured layers. New validation results based on in situ measurements during the ACRIDICON-CHUVA aircraft campaign in 2014 are used for bias correction. Contrasting CO monthly climatologies are presented for the Amazon Basin for the lower and upper troposphere (LT and UT) with an emphasis on the Amazonian dry season. Climatologically, spatial patterns of UT CO over the Amazon Basin appear to be related to both deep convection and anticyclonic flow. Strongly enhanced LT basin-mean CO concentrations are observed for the dry season months in 2005, 2007, 2010, and 2015, while the record also indicates a decreasing long-term trend. These observations are consistent with the expected effects of falling deforestation rates since 2004, punctuated by CO spikes in drought years due to large-scale wildfires. Plain Language Summary Satellite observations of carbon monoxide (CO) from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere instrument since 2000 are used to analyze pollution from fires in the Amazon Basin. It is shown that decreasing deforestation can result in reduced levels of CO, but that fires related to climate variability produce larger changes in CO concentrations.",NA,NA,webofscience,satellite-based analysis of co seasonal and interannual variability over the amazon basin,paper_1209

For the generation of thematic maps was used to LEGAL Analysis (GIS Spatial Algebraic Language), tool that enables spatial analysis using map algebra. From the generation of thematic maps were calculated areas where there was the expansion of native forests (7.55% of total area) - areas where natural regeneration has occurred, becoming forest in 2010. The area that has remained the use of native forest over 18 years is 2.83% of the total area. Deforestation, forest areas belonging to native and has reverted to another use, is 1.23%. Reforestation, represented by the areas that now belong to the class planted forest was quantified at 0.57% of the total area of microregion. The remaining land use change (86.98% of total area) were among the other classes of land use. The work allowed us to observe the changes in land use over a period of 18 years, it was observed an increase in forest area, both native and planted.

Although decentralization is a good example of such a contextual phenomenon in multiple locations globally, it is rare to find quantitative empirical analyses of how it moderates PA effectiveness. We evaluate how the decentralization in Indonesia (proxied by the introduction of direct elections, district head (bupati) change, and district splitting) influenced PA effectiveness between 2000 and 2008. Focusing on three outcomes -deforestation, forest fragmentation, and fires, we apply a quasi-experimental approach to a carefully constructed spatially explicit village-level panel dataset, combined with geospatial biophysical and physio-geographic data. We hypothesize that the moderating influence of decentralization on PA effectiveness depends on whether decentralization increased threats to forests, strengthened local accountability, or weakened enforcement. On average, we find direct elections improved the PA impact in terms of reducing deforestation in protected villages, but had no statistically significant effect on forest fragmentation, fires, or leakage. On average, we find district splitting increased forest fragmentation in the recently protected villages, but had no statistically significant impact on deforestation and fires. On average, we find the bupati change had no statistically discernible influence on PA impacts on deforestation, fragmentation or fires. Given the increasing threats to forests due to decentralization, these results imply that district splitting and the bupati change weakened enforcement inside PAs with regards to deforestation and forest fragmentation, in contrast to direct elections. By highlighting the potential channels through which decentralization in Indonesia impacted forests, we offer insights into the effectiveness of a common conservation policy in the country. Broadly, we contribute to the conservation impact evaluation literature by quantitatively examining how political economy influences the performance of conservation policies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

One salient aspect of the spread of commercial liberalism in the world has been the growth in international trade. The spread of republican liberalism has manifested itself by the rise in the level of democracy in countries over time. What are the implications of trade and democracy for the terrestrial environment? Two bodies of literature are relevant to this question: one studies the effect of trade on the environment, while a second body focuses on the effect of democracy on the environment. The effects of both forces on the environment are debated theoretically and empirically. The two bodies of literature have generally developed separately, and the effects of trade and democracy have not been evaluated in the same model. This paper discusses the theoretical effects of trade and democracy on the environment, and develops a statistical model to study these effects on the terrestrial environment in the areas of deforestation and land degradation. The results indicate that a rise in trade openness reduces deforestation in autocracy and increases deforestation in democracy, and the effect is similar for the less developed countries (LDCs) and the developed countries (DCs). A rise in trade openness reduces land degradation, but the effect is not robust and does not depend on regime type. A rise in democracy increases deforestation and reduces land degradation, but these effects are weaker in LDCs than in DCs. In addition, the effect of democracy on deforestation is stronger when trade openness is high. The effect of democracy on land degradation does not depend on trade openness. The paper concludes with an examination of the implications of these results for public policy.",NA,NA,webofscience,the effects of liberalism on the terrestrial environment,paper_1348

Samples, collected by local forestry workers (Forest Enterprise staff) on a campaign basis on up to eight occasions, were for 16 mature first rotation standing forest: the remainder represented areas completely clear felled from less than one to up to forty years previously. As the waters drain acidic and acid sensitive soils, acidic runoff is often encountered. However, higher pH values with associated positive alkalinities and base cation enrichments are observed due to the influence of weathering reactions within the bedrock. There is little systematic variation in water quality between baseflow and stormflow for each site indicating a complex and erratic contribution of waters from the soil and underlying parent material. 80% or more of the data points show hardly any changes with felling time, but there are a few outlier points with much higher concentrations that provide important information on the processes operative. The dearest outlier felling response is for nitrate at five of the more recently felled sites on brown earth, gley and podzolic soil types. ANC, the prime indicator of stream acidity, shows a diverse response from both high to low outlier values (>+400 to -300 mu Eq/1). In parallel to nitrate, aluminium, potassium and barium concentrations are higher in waters sampled up to 4 years post felling, but the time series response is even less clear than that for nitrate. Cadmium, zinc and lead and lanthanides/actinides show large variations from site to site due to localized vein ore-mineralization in the underlying bedrock. The survey provides a strong indication that forest harvesting can have marked local effects on some chemical components of runoff for the first four years after felling but that this is confined to a small number of sites where nitrate production and aluminium leaching are high. In general, deforestation leads to a reversal of acidification when the nitrate pulse is low. The variability in water quality from catchment to catchment is too high for generalized conclusions to be made over the extent of the potential changes from site to site. The value of an organised campaign of opportunistic sampling using an infrastructure of enthusiastic staff from regionally dispersed organisations associated with environmental matters (in this case the forestry industry) is highlighted.",NA,NA,webofscience,the impacts of conifer harvesting on runoff water quality: a regional survey for wales,paper_1379

The most important factor behind this rapid decline in BES has been attributed to the different land use changes such as agricultural expansion, urbanization, and deforestation practices. Therefore, the present study intends to understand the impacts of land use changes along with the effects of egalitarian democracy, human capital and globalization on BES taking a sample of 20 countries where ecosystem services and biodiversity are most fragile during 1990-2019 period. The study employs robust econometric models that can tackle the problem of cross-sectional dependence within the data. The finding demonstrates that agricultural expansion and urbanization both negatively and significantly affect the BES whereas forest area is positively associated with BES. The impacts of egalitarian democracy, human capital development as well as that of globalization are found to be decreasing the BES loss.

The objective was to damage the brand image of Nestle and, thereby, force the organization to make its supply chain more sustainable. Prominent cases such as these have led to the prevailing view that sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) is primarily reactive and propelled by external pressures. This research, in contrast, assumes that SSCM can contribute positively to the reputation of an organization as a good citizen and, thereby, counter the impression that external stakeholder pressure is the only driver of SSCM. The study draws on Resource Dependence Theory in analyzing the three competing models of the potential stakeholder, SSCM and the corporate sustainability performance relationship. A dataset of 1,621 organizations allows the statistical comparison of these three models. Findings suggest that stakeholder pressure and SSCM both contribute to an organization's sustainability performance. Thus, supply chain managers will perceive benefits from SSCM other than merely the reduction of risk from reputational damage through stakeholder activism.",NA,NA,webofscience,"the relationship between sustainable supply chain management, stakeholder pressure and corporate sustainability performance",paper_1433

Through advice, education and training, joint research and exchange of experiences, information and technical know-how, cooperation can bring together baseline information for the world's community. In this way, developed countries and international forestry and forestry research organizations can assist developing countries to enhance dialogue, partnerships and inter-relationships in forestry at a global level. NGOs also can play an intermediary role between government and the private sector. They are becoming increasingly important in facilitating the transfer of technology, for promoting public awareness and negotiating on international environment issues. Government support for NGOs has enabled the organizations to perform their work better and more efficiently. The establishment of the Northeast Asian Forest Forum (NEAFF) in Mongolia and China is timely and meaningful in the sense that the Mongolian and Chinese governments are working diligently to plant trees and combat desertification. The governments are no longer able to tolerate environmental degradation accumulated over the past several decades. NEAFF in Seoul fully supports the collaborative efforts between Korea, China and Mongolia, universities and research institutions in Korea, and international tree-planting NGOs in the international campaign to plant trees on bare lands and desert in China and Mongolia. Such efforts to expand projects in reforestation and combating desertification, especially within the two countries, will provide opportunities for neighbouring countries to expand their dialogue, as well as bridge differences, by addressing common environmental issues across these regions. A network is being developed, and part of this work is already in progress to promote synergies and comparative research on the forest ecosystems of northeast Asian countries. The key to a successful network is the coordination of activities by the participating countries.

However, the effects of titling on forest cover are unclear. Rigorous analyses of titling campaigns are rare, and related theoretical and empirical research suggests that they could either stem or spur forest damage. We analyze such a campaign in the Peruvian Amazon, where more than 1,200 indigenous communities comprising some 11 million ha have been titled since the mid-1970s. We use community-level longitudinal data derived from high-resolution satellite images to estimate the effect of titling between 2002 and 2005 on contemporaneous forest clearing and disturbance. Our results indicate that titling reduces clearing by more than three-quarters and forest disturbance by roughly two-thirds in a 2-y window spanning the year title is awarded and the year afterward. These results suggest that awarding formal land titles to local communities can advance forest conservation.",NA,NA,webofscience,titling indigenous communities protects forests in the peruvian amazon,paper_1476

We conducted an extensive ground verification campaign through 36 landscapes in 9 regions of Zambia, Ecuador and Philippines, which constitute a gradient of pantropical deforestation contexts or forest transitions. We collected over 16,000 ground control points and digitized over 18,000 ha with details on land use and forest disturbance history. We trained a random forest algorithm and generated high-resolution (30 m) binary forest maps covering ~15 Mha, building on 39 optical (Landsat-8), radar (Sentinel-1) and elevation bands, indices and textures. We validated the quality of the outputs across the studied deforestation gradient and compared them to (a): 3 national land cover maps used for international reporting, (b): 4 global forest datasets (Global Forest Change, Copernicus Land Cover, JAXA and TanDEM-X Forest/Non-Forest). Our method generated highly accurate (92%) forest maps for the studied regions when compared to the global datasets, which generally overestimated forest cover. We achieved accuracies similar to the national maps, following a standardized method for all countries. The difficulties in delineating forest increased in more advanced stages of deforestation, with recurring struggles to distinguish non-forest tree-based systems (e.g. perennials, palms, or agroforestry), shrublands and grasslands. Regrowth forests were repeatedly misclassified across contexts, countries and datasets, in contrast to reference or degraded forests. Our results highlight the importance of in situ verification as accompanying method to establish efficient forest monitoring systems, especially in areas with higher rates of forest cover change and in tropical regions of advanced deforestation or early reforestation stages. These are precisely the areas where current REDD+ or Forest Landscape Restoration initiatives take place.",NA,NA,webofscience,towards accurate mapping of forest in tropical landscapes: a comparison of datasets on how forest transition matters,paper_1483

The analysis finds a robust association between trust and deforestation while controlling for other theoretically relevant factors governing forest use, including democracy and economic development. Our results further illustrate how social capital, in this case trust, explains how well society manages its common-pool resources. Since trust arises within voluntary associations and through participation in collective action, one of the policy implications is for national and subnational governments to enable and encourage the formation of groups devoted to forest governance, as well increasing opportunities to participate in shared governance of forests.",NA,NA,webofscience,trust and deforestation: a cross-country comparison,paper_1513

Between 2003 and 2011, public audits of federal funds increased deforestation by about 10% in municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon within the first three years after the audit. The audits triggered forest loss, especially during election years, in municipalities governed by first-term mayors who managed to win re-elections afterwards, and in places with a high share of cattle ranching, indicating potential collusion between local politicians and the agricultural sector.",NA,NA,webofscience,unintended environmental consequences of anti-corruption strategies,paper_1529

By using the retail resilience theoretical framework, this research seeks to understand the disruption in retail systems, both from socio-economic and environmental indicators. Comparing the environmentally sensitive discourses promoted by Chilean retailers in advertising campaigns and corporate speeches with the environmental effects that large retail buildings brought to the surrounding areas in terms of urban deforestation and increasing superficial temperature, this paper probes that greenwashing campaign are not only used to impact corporate legitimacy with consumers and investors but also to deliberately diminish the environmental responsibilities of private developers in vulnerable urban areas.",NA,NA,webofscience,urban shopping malls and sustainability approaches in chilean cities: relations between environmental impacts of buildings and greenwashing branding discourses,paper_1533

There has been a concerted international effort to develop remote sensing techniques to monitor broad-scale patterns of forest canopy disturbance. In addition to loss of natural resources, recent deforestation in Mesoamerica threatens historic cultural resources that for centuries lay hidden below the protective canopy. Here, we compare satellite-derived measures of canopy disturbance that occurred over a three decade period since 1980 to those derived from a 2009 airborne LiDAR campaign over the Caracol Archaeological Reserve in western Belize. Scaling up fine-resolution canopy height measures to the 30 m resolution of Landsat Thematic Mapper, we found LiDAR revealed a >58% increase in the extent of canopy disturbance where there was an overlap of the remotely sensed data sources. For the entire archaeological reserve, with the addition of LiDAR, there was a 2.5% increase of degraded canopy than estimated with Landsat alone, indicating that 11.3% of the reserve has been subjected to illegal selective logging and deforestation. Incursions into the reserve from the Guatemala border, represented by LiDAR-detected canopy disturbance, extended 1 km deeper (to 3.5 km) into Belize than were derived with Landsat. Thus, while LiDAR enables a synoptic, never-seen-before, below-canopy view of the Maya city of Caracol, it also reveals the degree of canopy disturbance and potential looting of areas yet to be documented by archaeologists on the ground.",NA,NA,webofscience,use of airborne lidar to delineate canopy degradation and encroachment along the guatemala-belize border,paper_1537

Examples include the United Nations Billion Trees Campaign, the National Greening Program in the Philippines, and the 5 million ha reforestation program in Vietnam. However, while substantial investments are being made in reforestation, little information exists on the drivers influencing reforestation success and how these interact to determine environmental and socio-economic outcomes. In this study we surveyed 43 reforestation projects on Leyte Island, The Philippines to identify the drivers that most influence reforestation success as measured by key indicators drawn from the literature, including interactions between drivers and between drivers and indicators. We investigated 98 potential success drivers, including technical and biophysical factors; socio-economic factors; institutional, policy and management factors; and reforestation project characteristics. We also measured 12 success indicators, including forest establishment, forest growth, environmental and socio-economic success indicators. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to identify significant relationships among drivers and indicators and this analysis was used to develop a system of driver and indicator relationships. Based on this we found that revegetation method, funding source, education and awareness campaigns, the dependence of local people on forests, reforestation incentives, project objectives, forest protection mechanisms and the condition of road infrastructure were highly connected drivers that influenced multiple success indicators either directly or indirectly. We conclude that policies targeting revegetation methods, socioeconomic incentives, forest protection mechanisms, sustainable livelihoods, diversification of funding and partnerships, technical support, and infrastructure development are likely to have a broad systemic and beneficial effect on the success of reforestation programs in tropical developing countries.
