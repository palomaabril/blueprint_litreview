Using a district-level panel data set from 2001 to 2016, we analyze variation in remotely sensed forest losses as well as measures of land-use licensing. We link these outcomes to political incentives arising before idiosyncratically-timed local mayoral elections as well as to price exposure measures based on oil palm soil suitability combined with global price variations for palm oil. Empirical results document increases of about 4% in deforestation in the year prior to local mayoral elections on average. Additionally, palm oil plays a crucial role in driving deforestation dynamics. Deforestation rates increase by 7% in places that experience a one standard deviation increase in local price exposure, but no upcoming elections. These effects are amplified to almost 19% larger forest losses in places that experience pre-election years and a standard deviation higher palm oil price exposure at the same time. We thus find clear evidence for economic and political incentives reinforcing each other as drivers of forest loss and land conversion for oil palm cultivation. (C) 2021 The Authors.

In this review, we outline the theoretical links between democracy and biodiversity conservation and review the empirical literature testing them. While more studies reported a positive than a negative relation between democracy and biodiversity conservation (15 vs. 11), the most common result was a mixed relationship (28), often conditioned on economic factors. The use of different proxies to measure biodiversity, including deforestation, protected areas, threatened species, and fishery statistics emerged as a primary obstacle for synthesis. We suggest overcoming this caveat together with a consistent definition of democratic institutions and a standardized statistical framework as research priorities to improve policies against the global biodiversity loss.",NA,NA,"webofscience","linking democracy and biodiversity conservation: empirical evidence and research gaps","paper_905"

This study reviews the current status of mangrove ecology, management and conservation in Sri Lanka. In 2015, Sri Lanka became the first nation to legally protect all its mangrove forests; hence mangrove management in Sri Lanka may act as an important exemplar for other nations. Mangroves are found sporadically in the coastal area of Sri Lanka, including as a few dense mangrove forests. Mangrove vegetation provides a cost-effective ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction capability in Sri Lanka, particularly in the areas with poor living standards. Mangroves are used for timber, fishing materials, medicine and food in the country. Despite the environmental and socioeconomic importance of mangroves, several threats, including the expansion of aquaculture and agriculture, urbanization, pollution, climate change and sea level rise, exist in Sri Lanka. Many mangrove reforestation and afforestation initiatives in Sri Lanka have not succeeded, often because of the lack of sufficient monitoring of seedlings after the reforestation campaign and poor selection of planting sites without proper assessment of environmental conditions. In order to protect mangrove forests in Sri Lanka, some immediate measures need to be implemented. Proper planting of seedlings, community-based mangrove reforestation, sustainable aquaculture practices and proper legal enforcement are some of the important steps for the conservation of this highly productive ecosystem in the country.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Using the synthetic control method, we find that the project resulted in an overall reduction of 35% in the number of days on which an average forest grid cell was detected to be on fire in the month of the year when fires tend to be most prevalent-November, at the very end of the agricultural season. This impact is, however, short lived (as the reduction only occurred in the November months in the first 4 years of the program), and the overall reduction in forest fire occurrences was not sufficiently large to result in a detectable increase in vegetation cover.

The parameters for the main pan-tropical allometric equations are tree height and diameter and specific timber density, but none of the trees measured are from African forests. The few equations established for Africa turn out to be insufficient, in particular because large trees are not sufficiently represented in the samples measured. To address this data deficit, we measured 55 trees with a diameter of 10 to 120 cm, from 23 different species in a dense semi-deciduous forest in south-eastern Cameroon. After felling, the logs were cross-cut and measured until the one centimetre in diameter cutting. The sample was used to link the diameter and total timber volume of the trees via polynomial non-linear models (addition and multiplication). Then tree biomass should be deduced by applying the specific density and a correction factor for foliage. In order to refine these measurements, the sample will be enlarged during a further measurement campaign to produce a closer estimation of the total volume of huge trees.",NA,NA,"webofscience","formulating an equation for cameroon timber between tree diameter and the total timber volume of trees","paper_696"

Agroforestry, a system in which woody perennials are grown on the same land as agricultural crops or livestock, has been increasingly enlisted in the campaign to meet these threats to the rural economy. Case studies of twenty-one agroforestry projects in six Central American and two Caribbean countries formed the empirical basis for the study described in this article. A focal point of analysis was the profitability of agroforestry for farmers as a crucial incentive to adoption. The findings indicate that many agroforestry practices are profitable under a broad range of conditions and are therefore likely to be widely applicable. Successful projects have worked with local communities, responding to local needs and preferences and offering farmers a broad basket of species and systems from which to choose. Demonstration plots and the use of paratechnicians have been low-cost and effective means of technology transfer, and applied research has been important in identifying techniques and practices suited to the region. Other findings have identified government regulation of tree harvesting and insecurity of tenure-though not lack of title in itself-as disincentives to adoption.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the costs and benefits of agroforestry to farmers","paper_1329"

In Northeastern China, summer (June to August) streamflow accounts for about 50% of total annual streamflow and is vital to water supply and management in the region. Understanding how forest recovery may affect streamflow is important to both reforestation campaign and long-term water sustainability. In this study, we analysed 33 years of summer hydrologic data (1970-2002) from two comparable small-scale watersheds located in the Xiaoxing'anling, Northeastern China. Time series analysis and two graphic methods (double mass curve and flow duration curve) with statistical testing as well as long-term data on forest cover changes and climate were used. Our results show that the significant streamflow reduction as a result of reforestation occurred when forest cover reached 70% or 10 years after planting. After forest cover reached 85%, water reduction became stabilized. The accumulative streamflow reduction in 2002 reached 8.61% of the total accumulative streamflow. Among those water reduced, high flows (from 5 to 25 percentiles) were mostly affected, demonstrating that northeastern forests have an important role in reducing high flows. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of climate change, reforestation and water resource management.

It is hypothesized that differences in deforestation among countries can be attributed to their colonial legacies shaping the current impact of the institutional background on deforestation. Overall, the author finds that institutions defined as the extent of democracy, the quality of property rights and the quality of government functioning (e.g., corruption), have a differential impact on deforestation rates according to colonial legacies as defined by the identity of the colonizer. More precisely, it is found that: (1) in countries characterized by 'bad' governance, former French colonies deforest relatively less than former British and Spanish colonies; whereas (2) in countries characterized by 'good' governance, the result is reversed. These results are robust when geography features are controlled for since the process of colonization was not random and depended on initial geographic and climatic conditions.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the colonial origins of deforestation: an institutional analysis","paper_1321"

Most of the devastated forests have been afforested by the large-scale afforestation campaign in the 1970s through 1980s on a national level in Korea; for this reason, there have been very few places currently available for afforestation and reforestation. Therefore, the domestic forest policy in accordance with the UNFCCC should focus on how to ensure carbon sinks through forest tending activities (forest management) with the plan, in which 4.9million ha of stand for production forest land are recognized as greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks by 2022 rather than on how to obtain them through afforestation. In addition, the methods of the afforestation,of marginal agricultural land with low productivity and the formation and expansion of urban forest have been established to overcome the limitations of forest land area where afforestation could be performed. Furthermore, the policy of preventing forest disaster, controlling deforestation and expanding forest bio-energy and the use of wood products has been performed as the measures of carbon emission source.

A major problem when estimating biomass from optical and SAR remote sensing images is the saturation effect. As a solution, PolInSAR offers a high coverage height map that can be transformed into a biomass map. Temporal decorrelation may affect the accuracy of PolInSAR and may also have an effect on the accuracy of the biomass estimates. In this study, we compared three different height estimation models: the Random-Volume-over-Ground (RVoG), Random-Motion-over-Ground (RMoG), and Random-Motion-over-Ground-Legendre (RMoG) models. The RVoG model does not take into account the temporal decorrelation, while the other two compensate for temporal decorrelation but differ in structure function. The comparison was done on 214 field plots of the 10 m radius of the BioSAR2010 campaign. Different models relating PolInSAR height and biomass were developed by using polynomial, exponential, power series, and piece-wise linear regression. Different strategies for training and test subset selection were followed to obtain the best possible regression models. The study showed that the RMoGmodel provided the most accurate biomass predictions. The relation between RMoGs height and biomass is well expressed by the exponential model with an average RMSE equal to 48 ton value equal to 0.62. The relative errors for estimated biomass were equal to 46% for the RVoG model, to 37% for the RMoG, and to 30% for the RMoG model. We concluded that taking the temporal decorrelation into account for estimating tree height has a significant effect on providing accurate biomass estimates.",NA,NA,"webofscience","assessment of forest above-ground biomass estimation from polinsar in the presence of temporal decorrelation","paper_145"

Focusing on the recent forest conservation policy of Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a leading pulp and paper company operating in Southeast Asia, we analyze the challenges companies face in implementing sustainability commitments made as a result of NGO and market pressure. Drawing from research on policy implementation and corporate greening we identify key activities to help entrench APP's commitments in the company's operations. Furthermore, we suggest that a range of actions by different stakeholder groups can achieve broader effects of APP's commitments toward better environmental and social stewardship in the region's pulp and paper sector.

This tendency is even more marked in the Sudanian and Sahelian zones with a long dry season, and explains the lack of knowledge on the potential of native or local tree species and suitable sylvicultural methods. To contribute to the acquisition of this essential knowledge, a 2.56 ha arboretum was established in 1990 in the Korhogo area in northern Cote d'Ivoire. A particular feature lies in the establishment of large parcels (1,596 m(2)) with 224 saplings of each species. The aim was to allow sylvicultural treatment that would conserve 10 to 16 adult trees of each species, in particular for their timber, by the end of each rotation. Because nursery techniques for some of the species were insufficiently mastered, the 244 saplings per species initially planned were only planted for 12 of the 22 species. The results are shown for all of the species tested, both in the nursery and once planted out. This arboretum was regularly monitored until 1999, when proper management was disrupted by political upheaval in the country. A measurement campaign was set in motion in November 2019, which brought interesting conclusions as to the aptitude for growth of 15 species in even-aged single-species stands, two of which (Pterocarpus erinaceus Poir. and Anogeissus leiocarpa (DC.) Guill. & Perr.) show outstanding productivity. All of the data collected as from seed harvesting and throughout the life of the arboretum are presented and discussed here, in the hope that this will be of benefit to foresters in this phytogeographical area. The lessons learned should be applied to forest and landscape restoration through the reforestation commitments made by countries to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services to populations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","three decades of monitoring 22 native tree species planted in an arboretum in korhogo in northern cote d'ivoire","paper_1474"

The implementation of a simple land surface parameterization, Interactions between Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA), has gained from previous validations and calibrations at local scale against field datasets and from aggregation procedures devised to define effective land surface properties. Specific improvements for climate purposes are introduced: spatial variability of convective rainfall in canopy drainage estimation and subsurface gravitational percolation. The methodology used to derive climatological maps of land surface parameters at the grid-scale resolution of the model from existing databases for soil and vegetation types at global scale is described. A 3-yr integration for the present day climate with a T42L30 version of the climate model has been performed. Results obtained compare favorably with available observed climatologies related to the various components of the continental surface energy and water budgets. Differences are due mostly to a poor simulation of the precipitation field. However, some differences suggest specific improvements in the surface scheme concerning representation of the bare soil albedo, the surface runoff, and the soil moisture initialization. As a first step prior to tropical deforestation experiments presented in Part II, regional analyses over the Amazon forest indicate that the modeled evaporation and net radiation are in good agreement with data collected during the Amazon Region Micrometeorological Experiment campaign.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the land-surface scheme isba within the meteo-france climate model arpege .1. implementation and preliminary-results","paper_1387"

However, pristine peat swamp forests are vanishing due to deforestation and peatland degradation, especially in Southeast Asia. CO2 emissions associated with this land use change might not only come from the peat soil directly but also from peat-draining rivers. So far, though, this has been mere speculation, since there has been no data from undisturbed reference sites. We present the first combined assessment of lateral organic carbon fluxes and CO2 outgassing from an undisturbed tropical peat-draining river. Two sampling campaigns were undertaken on the Maludam River in Sarawak, Malaysia. The river catchment is covered by protected peat swamp forest, offering a unique opportunity to study a peat-draining river in its natural state, without any influence from tributaries with different characteristics. The two campaigns yielded consistent results. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged between 3222 and 6218 mu mol L-1 and accounted for more than 99% of the total organic carbon (TOC). Radiocarbon dating revealed that the riverine DOC was of recent origin, suggesting that it derives from the top soil layers and surface runoff. We observed strong oxygen depletion, implying high rates of organic matter decomposition and consequently CO2 production. The measured median pCO(2) was 7795 and 8400 mu atm during the first and second campaign, respectively. Overall, we found that only 32 +/- 19% of the carbon was exported by CO2 evasion, while the rest was exported by discharge. CO2 outgassing seemed to be moderated by the short water residence time. Since most Southeast Asian peatlands are located at the coast, this is probably an important limiting factor for CO2 outgassing from most of its peat-draining rivers.",NA,NA,"webofscience","lateral carbon fluxes and co2 outgassing from a tropical peat-draining river","paper_891"

In most cases, about one-third of the fuel chlorine ended up in the particles and about one-half remained in the ash. About 50% of the mass of non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) emitted by these fires could be identified with the available instrumentation. The lab fire emission factors (EF, g compound emitted per kg dry fuel burned) were coupled with EF obtained during the TROFFEE airborne and ground-based field campaigns. This revealed several types of EF dependence on parameters such as the ratio of flaming to smoldering combustion and fuel characteristics. The synthesis of data from the different TROFFEE platforms was also used to derive EF for all the measured species for both primary deforestation fires and pasture maintenance fires - the two main types of biomass burning in the Amazon. Many of the EF are larger than those in widely-used earlier work. This is mostly due to the inclusion of newly-available, large EF for the initially-unlofted smoldering emissions from residual logs in pastures and the assumption that these emissions make a significant contribution (similar to 40%) to the total emissions from pasture fires. The TROFFEE EF for particles with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 microns (EFPM2.5) is 14.8 g/ka for primary deforestation fires and 18.7 g/kg for pasture maintenance fires. These EFPM2.5 are significantly larger than a previous recommendation (9.1 g/kg) and lead to an estimated pyrogenic primary PM2.5 source for the Amazon that is 84% larger. New regional budgets for biogenic and pyrogenic emissions were roughly estimated. Coupled with an estimate of secondary aerosol formation in the Amazon and source apportionment Studies, the regional budgets suggest that similar to 5% of the total mass of the regionally generated NMOC end up as secondary organic aerosol within the Amazonian boundary layer within 1-3 days. New global budgets confirm that biogenic emissions and biomass burning are the two largest global sources of NMOC with an estimated production of approximately 1000 (770-1400) and 500 (250-630) Tg/yr, respectively. It follows that plants and fires may also be the two main global Sources of secondary organic aerosol. A limited set of emission ratios (ER) is given for sugar cane burning which may help estimate the air quality impacts of burning C, this major or crop, which is often grown in densely populated areas.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the tropical forest and fire emissions experiment: laboratory fire measurements and synthesis of campaign data","paper_1456"

However, others argue that democracy leads to environmental degradation. We revisit this contentious relationship between regime type and environment degradation in the context of deforestation. Using panel data on 139 countries during the 1990-2012 period, we find that democracy is associated with lower levels of forest coverage. Although our results appear counter-intuitive, further analyses reveal the positive effect of democracy on forest area coverage is conditional upon the level of economic development. Roughly, at per capita income of about US$8200, the impact of democracy on forest coverage becomes positive. Our results suggest that a democratic government's priority to tackle environmental problems depends on its level of economic development. These results also highlight the fundamental reason as to why there is a lack of coordinated effort between developing and developed countries in addressing environmental issues.",NA,NA,"webofscience","does democracy guarantee (de)forestation? an empirical analysis","paper_488"

Where transitions are underway or anticipated, historical precedent and methods for systematically assessing future trends should be used to anticipate likely threats to forest conservation and design appropriate and prescient policy measures to counteract them. Myanmar is transitioning from an authoritarian, centralized state with a highly regulated economy to a more decentralized and economically liberal democracy and is working to end a long-running civil war. With these transitions in mind, we used a horizon-scanning approach to assess the 40 emerging issues most affecting Myanmar's forests, including internal conflict, land-tenure insecurity, large-scale agricultural development, demise of state timber enterprises, shortfalls in government revenue and capacity, and opening of new deforestation frontiers with new roads, mines, and hydroelectric dams. Averting these threats will require, for example, overhauling governance models, building capacity, improving infrastructure-and energy-project planning, and reforming land-tenure and environmental-protection laws. Although challenges to conservation in Myanmar are daunting, the political transition offers an opportunity for conservationists and researchers to help shape a future that enhances Myanmar's social, economic, and environmental potential while learning and applying lessons from other countries. Our approach and results are relevant to other countries undergoing similar transitions.",NA,NA,"webofscience","political transition and emergent forest-conservation issues in myanmar","paper_1054"

Using in situ data from a 2008-2009 forest inventory field campaign, in Sri Lanka, this study describes the structural characteristics and carbon stocks of six natural forest types. This paper has a dual scope: i) to highlight the variation in carbon stored in aboveground biomass within and between forest types and ii) to determine the implications of the allometric equations chosen to calculate biomass carbon stocks. This study concerns work related to climate change interventions, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and other forest-related, performance-based initiatives that require proper monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon stocks, sinks and emissions. The results revealed that forests are heterogeneous in terms of tree density and height-diameter relationships, both between and within the six forest types investigated. The mean aboveground carbon stock in the different forest types ranged from 22 to 181 Mg C ha(-1), and there were statistically significant differences in the carbon stocks of the six forest types in 7 of 15 cases. The estimated carbon stock depended heavily on the allometric equation used for the calculations, the variables, and its application to the specific life zone. Due to the diversity of forest structures, these results suggest that caution should be taken when applying default values to estimate forest carbon stocks and emission values in reporting and accounting schemes. The results also indicated the need for allometric equations that are context-specific for different forest types. Therefore, new field investigations and measurements are needed to determine these specific allometric equations, as well as the potential variation in forest carbon stocks in tropical natural forests.

Forest carbon sink is an important ecosystem to sequestrate carbon for mitigating climate change which is a supplementary measure in addition to the strategies of energy saving and emission reduction. The role of institutional freedom playing in forest protection and which path to achieve forest carbon sink development are worthy of research. The nexus between the social, economic, and the environment should be explored. This paper uses data of 139 countries to explore this problem and proposes three transfer paths assumptions of land use structure, education, and income inequality. The three hypotheses are verified by the mediating model. The three transfer paths are analyzed under different levels of economic growth by the mediating model combined with the threshold model. The results show that the role of education as a transfer path is very clear and income inequality can promote the increase of forest carbon sinks in the case of higher institutional freedom. The three path hypothesis conclusions and related policy implications are summarized by analyzing the results.",NA,NA,"webofscience","how does institutional freedom affect global forest carbon sinks? the analysis of transfer paths","paper_775"

The aim of TERENO is to foster the understanding of water, energy, and matter fluxes in terrestrial systems, as well as their biological and physical drivers. Part of the Lower Rhine Valley-Eifel observatory of TERENO is located within the Eifel National Park. Recently, the National Park forest management started to promote the natural regeneration of near-natural beech forest by removing a significant proportion of the spruce forest that was established for timber production after World War II. Within this context, the effects of such a disturbance on forest ecosystem functioning are currently investigated in a deforestation experiment in the Wustebach catchment, which is one of the key experimental research sites within the Lower Rhine Valley-Eifel observatory. Here, we present the integrated observation system of the Wustebach test site to exemplarily demonstrate the terrestrial observatory concept of TERENO that allows for a detailed monitoring of changes in hydrological and biogeochemical states and fluxes triggered by environmental disturbances. We present the observation platforms and the soil sampling campaign, as well as preliminary results including an analysis of data consistency. We specifically highlight the capability of integrated datasets to enable improved process understanding of the post-deforestation changes in ecosystem functioning.",NA,NA,"webofscience","a terrestrial observatory approach to the integrated investigation of the effects of deforestation on water, energy, and matter fluxes","paper_58"

The latter was considered to produce more accurate results. In a study area of 2 x 10(6) km(2), and during a 5-week period, the areas affected were estimated at 112,578 and 525,820 km(2) by the active fires and burnt area algorithms, respectively. Biomass densities, combustion factors, and emissions factors for Sudanian savanna, Guinean savanna, and dense tropical forest vegetation types were obtained from the literature, and used to estimate biomass burnt (228-371 Tg), and pyrogenic emissions of aerosols (1.8-2.6 Tg) and of the trace gases CO2 (374-609 Tg), CO (29.2-39.0 Tg), CH4 (2.05-2.73 Tg), and NOx (1.1-1.4 Tg). Because of its high biomass density, the tropical forest was a major source of atmospheric emissions, in spite of the relatively small extent of area burnt in this ecosystem. This highlights the need for particularly accurate estimates of area burnt, biomass density, combustion factor, and emissions factor for the dense tropical forest, as well as the potential for a significant increase in regional pyrogenic emissions as a consequence of deforestation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","satellite monitoring of fire in the expresso study area during the 1996 dry season experiment:: active fires, burnt area, and atmospheric emissions","paper_1208"

A total of 15 plots were surveyed during the field campaign and locally developed tree species-specific allometric equation was used for AGB calculation. The SAR images were pre-processed and calibrated to sigma nought (dB) for statistical AGB modeling. Nonlinear regression models between field-based AGB (ton/ha) and SAR backscatter sigma nought (dB) values give R-2 (0.47 and 0.55) and RMSE (1.18 and 1.87) values for HH and HV-pol data, respectively. AGB maps generated through these regression models from both HH and HV-pol data show similar AGB values and spatial patterns. Due to a small number of sample plots, the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) proxy validation method was used for model validation, between estimated and predicted backscatter sigma nought (dB) values. The validation R-2 values are small; however, outliers are identifiable in the validation scatterplots.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive examination of 2,778 counties in China, where the world's most ambitious FRP was executed during the past two decades. Results showed that, on average, each square kilometer of FRP yielded an additional 0.6 square kilometers of forests and contributed an extra 1354.9 tC to forest carbon storage, with the aridity index emerging as a key influencer. The actual expenditure incurred per ton of increased forest carbon storage amounted to approximately 118.9 USD in average, with the lowest in Southwest at 50.9 USD. The expansion of forest cover and enhanced biomass storage led to a notable increase in water consumption, and the trade-off was particularly pronounced in arid regions. Our study provides empirical evidence that FRP is an effective and cost-efficient climate change mitigation strategy for humid climate zones under current carbon prices. However, FRP is not cost-efficient in semi-arid and arid regions. These findings have significant implications for global forest restoration endeavors and formulating sound climate change mitigation policies.",NA,NA,"webofscience","national forest restoration projects in china: cost-efficiency, and trade-off between carbon sequestration and water consumption","paper_982"

Recent initiatives to evaluate the feasibility of malaria eradication have highlighted impacts of landscape changes on malaria transmission and the potential of these changes to undermine malaria control and elimination efforts. Multisectoral approaches are needed to detect and minimize negative impacts of land use and land cover changes on malaria transmission while supporting development aiding malaria control, elimination and ultimately eradication. Pathways through which land use and land cover changes disrupt social and ecological systems to increase or decrease malaria risks are outlined, identifying priorities and opportunities for a global malaria eradication campaign. The impacts of land use and land cover changes on malaria transmission are complex and highly context-specific, with effects changing over time and space. Landscape changes are only one element of a complex development process with wider economic and social dimensions affecting human health and wellbeing. While deforestation and other landscape changes threaten to undermine malaria control efforts and have driven the emergence of zoonotic malaria, most of the malaria elimination successes have been underpinned by agricultural development and land management. Malaria eradication is not feasible without addressing these changing risks while, conversely, consideration of malaria impacts in land management decisions has the potential to significantly accelerate progress towards eradication. Multisectoral cooperation and approaches to linking malaria control and environmental science, such as conducting locally relevant ecological monitoring, integrating landscape data into malaria surveillance systems and designing environmental management strategies to reduce malaria burdens, are essential to achieve malaria eradication.",NA,NA,"webofscience","achieving global malaria eradication in changing landscapes","paper_66"

It might be expected that after the changes restored political democracy in Spain in the late 1970s, a reorganization of the way the planning and implementation of soil and water conservation projects through reforestation would be changed. This paper considers the case of Guadalajara province as an example of the way in which reforestation has been effected at national level, and the consequences for the ecosystem. It examines how, since the 1940s, the technical methods used by forestry technicians have changed from concerns with protection to those of wood production. Although reforestation methods for wood production have been recognized as detrimental to soil and water conservation, they continue to be used even in the face of considerable opposition by local people and environmental pressure groups. The paper concludes that claims for soil protection mask a policy of wood production, excluding affected people from the decision-making process.

Using a panel data set that combines municipal-level deforestation and election data from 2002 to 2012, I estimate the effect of an incumbent mayor running for re-election on deforestation rates in election periods. I find that deforestation rates increase 8-10% in election years when an incumbent mayor runs for re-election, an amount equivalent to four percent of the total forest lost since the 2004 elections. Electoral deforestation cycles do not appear to be driven by changes in agricultural policy implementation and activity, but are linked to corruption and campaign finance, suggesting that weak institutional constraints facilitate electoral manipulation of forest resources. This phenomenon is not likely limited to Amazonian forests; re-election incentives could very well lead to misallocation of other natural resources in alternate geographies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Each NGO focused on nearby Reserve Forests and their resident langur populations and adjacent human communities. The community-conservation tools used included (1) Initial local community awareness campaigns, (2) formation of local Forest Committees and Self Help Groups, (3) a major regional awareness campaign about the golden langur and its forested habitat in the Manas Biosphere Reserve, and (4) creation of a number of village-based Forest Protection Forces The Golden Langur Conservation Project has resulted in an increase in the total Indian population of golden langurs, control of illegal logging and poaching in two isolated Reserve Forests by formation of a protection force of surrounding village groups, and curtailing illegal logging and increasing forest protection in the Reserve Forests of the Manas Biosphere Reserve by the formation of 10 tribal, government-sanctioned volunteer Forest Protection Forces.

Rural poverty is a serious phenomenon that poses a threat to economic opportunities, security and sustainable development of the rural poor. It involves land degradation caused by human-induced deforestation, agricultural and economic policies which negatively affect farming communities. Mass media play a greater role in reversing this trend in order to rescue the rural populace from the cycle of poverty, whose economic livelihood is directly dependent on land exploitation. Therefore, the paper examines role of print and electronic media in improving the lives of the rural poor. The study involved questionnaires and in-depth interviews. The sample respondents comprised of 200 staff of the media houses randomly selected. Therefore, to guide the study two hypotheses and three research questions were utilised. Similarly, the interview was conducted with five rural populace. The data collected were subjected to simple frequency count and percentage. Chi-squire statistical tools were used to test the null hypotheses. The findings of the study show that there is a significant relationship between unemployment and rural poverty. And there is no significant difference between media programmes and government campaign on rural poverty. The findings of the study also indicate that the role of mass media is public announcement, media jingles, sensitization and enlightenment campaign.

The panel specifically focuses on desertification, deforestation, and climate change as urgent global environmental threats possibly requiring Security Council action because of their potential to cause massive loss of life and undermine state functions. The report provokes important questions: If for example, a nation embarked upon a massive deforestation campaign which upset the ocean currents and threatened to send an entire continent into a deep freeze, would the Security Council be able to take measures against the offending nation to counteract this massive environmental threat? In this Note, Alexandra Knight argues that it is legally justified and legitimate for the Security Council, acting tinder the provisions of Chapter VII, Article 41 of the United Nations Charter, to impose measures to counter regional or global threats to the environment which pose a grave threat to human life and living conditions. While Chapter VII measures also include the use of force, Knight argues that only Article 41 measures-non-military measures like sanctions or interruption of communications-are appropriate to counter environmental threats.",NA,NA,"webofscience","global environmental threats: can the security council protect our earth?","paper_727"

The paper examines the reasons for deforestation and investigates the factors accountable for it. The analysis builds on authors-compiled cross-national dataset on 185 countries over the time period of twenty years, from 1990 to 2010. We find that, first, nation's intelligence reduces significantly the level of deforestation in a state. Moreover, the nations' IQ seems to play an offsetting role in the natural resource conservation (forest management) in the countries with weak democratic institutions. The analysis also discovered the presence of the U-shaped relationship between democracy and deforestation. Intelligence sheds more light on this interconnection and explains the results. Our results are robust to various sample selection strategies and model specifications. The main implication from our study is that intelligence not only shapes formal rules and informal regulations such as social trust, norms and traditions but also it has the ability to reverse the paradoxical process known as resource curse. The study contributes to better understanding of reasons of deforestation and shed light on the debated impact of political regime on forest management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

For several years non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are becoming increasingly interested in forestal matters, thus they become new protagonists of forest policy. This kind of development has been promoted through international agreements like the Agenda 21, which achieved an improvement of the working conditions for NGOs. Within this treaty the signatory states are asked to promote participation by various social groupings in political decision processes. In general, participation is possible on different levels, be it on local, regional, national or international scale. The participation of NGO's on deciding processes in forest policy is facing positive as well as negative aspects. Problematic are the deficiency of democracy of many NGO's, the undermining of decisions due to eloquent minorities, probably with increased expenditure and an enormous amount of time due to the participation of numerous groupings. Nevertheless, the present political scene as well as forest policy can no longer be pictured without participatory attempts. They are to be understood as a possibility ro just encounter the continuously increasing demands rewards forestry and to use the influence of other groupings or parts of the public for the sake of the forest-ecosystem.

Based on the assumption that the consumption of timber in the Northern hemisphere is largely responsible for deforestation, campaigners have focused on the global timber trade. From a strategy of boycotting tropical timber in the 1980s, environmentalists shifted their approach to one influenced by a discourse on 'sustainable development' in the 1990s. Believing that they could persuade loggers to use less predatory practices, the mainstream NGOs developed a certification scheme in association with timber companies known as the FSC - Forest Stewardship Council. Since then, the NGOs have gained influence over international policies. The focus on the so-called 'Amazon forestry vocation', however, may lead to doubtful results when sustainability of local societies and ecosystems is considered.

This local wisdom is fast eroding for such reasons as biotic interference, shrinking land resource base, deforestation, insufficient support from the government and public policies, and lack of appropriate management and institutional structure. In this context, this article, drawing on an empirical fieldwork, sheds some lights on the indigenous medicinal plants and associated practices in six selected locations of CHT. After a general introduction, the second section summaries selected key literature on the subject. The third section presents some observation on the medicinal plant resources in the study areas, while the next section introduces the practice of traditional healers or Baidyas together with their problems. The concluding section furnishes the following clues on improvement: (a) systematic documentation and recording of the existing medicinal plants; (b) organised motivational and awareness raising campaign regarding medicinal plants and their benefits; (c) establishment of experimental propagation nurseries; (d) research support for proper documentation and dissemination of the knowledge on medicinal plants and associated folk and herbal treatment methods; (e) utilisation of the local press, media and folk cultural practices as community-based extension and dissemination media to highlight the importance of medicinal plants and knowledge; (f) development of a network or platform to bring the Baidyas together by utilizing the community-based organisations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","a study on the indigenous medicinal plants and healing practices in chittagong hill tracts (bangladesh)","paper_54"

It addresses a contemporary conflict in the region, where an Indigenous people, the Munduruku, are resisting efforts by the Brazilian State to channelize the Tapajos River and exploit its hydropower potential. Development here represents an existential threat to the Munduruku, whose homeland resides in the river valley. It also represents an ecological threat to the global community. Although the rate of deforestation dropped after the turn of the millennium, it has begun to climb again and would no doubt accelerate with development in the Tapajos watershed and the opening of Central Amazonia to colonization and resource extraction. This would push the forest past its tipping point, a magnitude of deforestation capable of compromising rainfall recycling, and thus precipitating the transformation of the Amazonian forest into a patchwork of fireadapted shrubs and grasses. Tapajos describes how such an ecological catastrophe would occur. It also argues that the assertion of Indigenous territorial rights is key to the conservation of Amazonian biodiversity. The account unfolds against a background of conflict between Amazonia's Indigenous peoples and the Brazilian State. In so doing, it brings to life the realities of frontier violence involving both land conflict and the unrestrained behaviors of individuals living outside the institutional constraints of law. Such violence complicates the execution of field research in the region and contributes to its gathering ecological crisis.",NA,NA,"webofscience","tapajos","paper_1294"

Cerrado ecosystems depend on the historical fire regime to maintain their structure, biodiversity and functioning. The suppression of fire has transformed savanna vegetation into forests, causing biodiversity losses and drastic changes in ecological processes. 3. Policy implications. The National Fire Policy required by law must be urgently implemented in Brazil, including use of fire for Cerrado conservation in public and private lands on the basis of existing knowledge of indigenous people and scientists. Objective regulations on prescribed burning, land manager training, incentives for fire research and experimentation and a broad campaign to disseminate the benefits of fire for Cerrado conservation should be the cornerstones of the policy.

By including six additional years of research, this article more than doubles the evidence base to 320 spatially explicit econometric studies published in peer-reviewed academic journals from 1996 to 2019. We find that deforestation is consistently associated with greater accessibility (as influenced by natural features such as slope and elevation and built infrastructure such as roads, cities, and cleared areas) and with higher economic returns (from agriculture, livestock, and timber). Some demographic variables are consistently associated with less deforestation (e.g., Indigenous people, poverty, and age) or more deforestation (e.g., population), and others are not associated with the level of deforestation (e.g., education and gender). Policies that directly influence allowable land-use activities are associated with less deforestation (e.g., protected areas, enforcement of forest laws, payments for ecosystem services, community forest management, and certification of sustainable commodities). But policies and institutions that primarily seek other ends are not consistently associated with more or less deforestation (e.g., democracy, general governance, conflict abatement, and land-tenure security). We introduce reforestation and forest degradation as new dependent variables alongside deforestation. Greater population is consistently associated with more forest degradation, whereas steeper slope, greater distance from cities, and lower population are consistently associated with more reforestation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","what drives and stops deforestation, reforestation, and forest degradation? an updated meta-analysis","paper_1560"

Approaching penology as environmental history can therefore restore connections that have been severed between prison studies, political ecology, and geography. This article uses the Ushuaia penal colony/penitentiary, located in southernmost Argentina, to explore relationships between penology, inmate labor, and forestry. In the early 1900s, inmates erected the prison that would house them, and labored to provide roads, government buildings, and electricity for Ushuaia. Their main activity was felling timber, which brought together the prison and forestry departments, thus linking discipline with deforestation, and blurring the lines between the interior and exterior of the penitentiary. After decades of extensive forest fires, the lack of a self-sustaining economy, and charges of inmate abuse, the prison was closed in 1947. A subsequent campaign to salvage the region by supplanting ominous images of a natural prison with those of a beautiful landscape resulted in the establishment of a national park in 1960. And, in 1997, fifty years after its closure, the defunct prison was converted to a museum. The national park and prison museum now attract thousands of tourists annually, offering two competing - rather than co-constitutive - versions of national history. This juxtaposition of green and dark tourism is not unique to Ushuaia, and thus highlights tensions inherent to when and where sites of punishment, conservation, and memory overlap.

A negative campaign blaming illegal coffee producers for the loss of tigers in the Bukit Barisan Selatan (BBS) National Park in the province further complicates the issue, as the current coffee supply chain could not guarantee the workability of price transparency and asymmetric structures of coffee markets, to name a few. In this region, community initiatives have been developed to foster forest conservation by adopting coffee multi-strata practices under the agroforestry system and community-based forestry management in the buffer zone outside the BBS National Park. Based on research findings, buyer-driven regulation of environmental practices in the coffee industry, which characterize most global initiatives, have somehow restructured the supply chain in producing regions. Recent global sustainability standards require adequate organizational capacity of coffeefarmer groups and rural cooperatives involved in the supply chain. The paper recommends policy integration between bottom-up initiatives at farm level or institutional changes at supply-chain organizations, and top-down sustainability standards set by the private sector and non-government organizations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","global sustainability regulation and coffee supply chains in lampung province, indonesia","paper_730"

However, despite several theoretical explorations on the nexus, a dearth of empirical literature on the poverty-environmental degradation nexus, specifically on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), still exists. In this study, we investigated the poverty-environmental degradation nexus in SSA. We hypothesized that poverty is both a cause and effect of environmental degradation, and this relationship is explained as a vicious cycle. Unlike previous studies, we employed several alternative indicators of environmental degradation to examine the poverty-environmental degradation nexus in this study. We used data from 41 countries of SSA between 1996 and 2019 and employed the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. The findings suggest a cyclical relationship between poverty and environmental degradation in SSA, which confirms that an increase in poverty leads to an increase in environmental degradation, especially in deforestation and PM2.5 emissions. Similarly, the increase in environmental degradation positively affects poverty in SSA. We also confirmed that exogenous conditioning factors such as population growth rate, education, industrialization, and income inequality, institutional quality indicators such as governance effectiveness, control of corruption, freedom ad civil liberty, and democracy, and endogenous factors including fossil fuel energy use, fuelwood energy use, household health expenditure, infant mortality rate, and agriculture productivity influence the nexus between poverty and environmental degradation. The findings on the relationship between poverty and environmental degradation in SSA are a testimonial evidence that both poverty and environmental degradation are significant issues in SSA. Hence, poverty alleviation policies in SSA should not lead to PM2.5 emissions and deforestation, which may as well force people into a poverty-environmental degradation trap. Instead, poverty reduction policies should simultaneously achieve environmental conservation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","examination of the poverty-environmental degradation nexus in sub-saharan africa","paper_617"

Thus, the demand for groundwater use raised there what is specifically true for the Forest Experiment Center, managed by the NGO SOS Atlantic Forest and located within the Water Resources Management Unit (UGRHI) 10-Sorocaba and M & eacute;dio Tiet & ecirc;. Nowadays, there is incipient hydrogeochemical knowledge of those groundwater resources and, in addition to the area having suffered a severe water crisis, the water quality of the surface waters of this region is poor to regular, according to some reports, as a consequence of the activities developed there. Therefore, this study focused that site, aiming to get a better understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes occuring there and their implications for water quality, once the urban growth usually results in changes in the hydrologic cycle with possible pollutants releases. Physicochemical parameters and inorganic compounds of the waters were analyzed in order to identify possible anomalous concentrations of contaminants, especially those related to agricultural activities such as nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, since the area was used for agriculture before reforestation. The radionuclides radon (222Rn) and radium (226Ra) were also analyzed as the study area is located near the Botuxim deposit, a low-level nuclear waste disposal site that may be a possible source of contamination. Additional motivation for characterizing radon in the study area consisted on its use as a natural tracer to understand hydrogeological processes, as well as by its great risk to human health. This work has taken into account the results obtained during one monitoring campaign held for the following sampling: (1) nine tubular wells drilled at Tubar & atilde;o Aquifer System; (2) one surface water from a dam (reservoir) built in the area; (3) rainwater. Results show that groundwater samples are generally alkaline, with pH values between 6.24 and 8.51, and total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 67.22 to 119.17 mg/L. Those waters are slightly oxidizing, with Eh values between + 188 to + 284 mV. Most of groundwaters are sodium-bicarbonate dominated, except two samples that are mixed in terms of dissolved anions. The dam (reservoir) water and rainwater are mixed in terms of dissolved cations, but dominated by chloride (dam water) or bicarbonate (rainwater). The phosphate levels exceeded the Brazilian standards for human consumption in some samples, which is probably associated with the ancient agricultural activities of the region, because the aquifer's rocks are not naturally enriched in PO43-. 222Rn activity concentration reached a maximum value of 32.8 Bq/L, below of the previous WHO's recommended limit of 100 Bq/L, while the highest 226Ra activity concentration was 0.12 Bq/L, almost ten times lesser than the 1 Bq/L limit set by the WHO for drinking water. The findings of this investigation show that the radon and radium levels in the waters are within safe limits, indicating that probably there is no influence of the Botuxim deposit on the study area.

Specifically, we argue that in return for campaign contributions, Colombian mayors who rely on donor-funding (compared with those who do not) choose not to enforce sanctions against illegal deforestation activities. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that deforestation is significantly higher in municipalities that elect donor-funded as opposed to self-funded politicians. Further analysis shows that only part of this effect can be explained by differences in contracting practices by donor-funded mayors. Instead, evidence of heterogeneity in the effects according to the presence of alternative formal and informal enforcement institutions, and analysis of fire clearance, support the interpretation that campaign contributions buy reductions in the enforcement of environmental regulations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","buying a blind eye: campaign donations, regulatory enforcement, and deforestation","paper_199"

However, it suffers one of the highest rates of forest loss worldwide, mainly due to strong anthropogenic pressures. As Comorian populations depend on forest resources for subsistence, establishing relevant conservation strategies for their sustainable management requires the consideration of multiple stakeholders' perspectives toward biodiversity and habitat conservation. To better understand the relationships between humans and nature; how comorian people use natural resource and the relevance of a protected area for long-term biodiversity conservation, we used Q-methodology to assess local people's perceptions regarding biodiversity and conservation actions. Three discourses are identified during analysis: Pro-environment discourse, Keeping things as usual and Social and environmental concerns. According to the results, employed respondents, were favorable to long-term forest and biodiversity conservation. In contrast, unemployed respondents were in favor of more immediate benefits while unemployed but educated respondents were in favor to both long-term forest conservation and immediate benefits from forests. This suggests that poverty and a lack of access to basic services is associated with overharvesting of natural resources by rural people. These results suggest that biodiversity conservation of the Comoros archipelagos may benefit for plan aiming at (1) developing tourism and maintaining sustainable production of crops and livestock that could allow enhancing livelihoods and well-being of all social groups, (2) developing projects such as local markets that could allow villagers to sell agricultural productions, (3) setting up awareness campaign for tree-planting and reforestation. Reforestation could allow re-establishing natural plants and make large trees available for long-term purposes.",NA,NA,"webofscience","understanding drivers of unsustainable natural resource use in the comoro islands","paper_1523"

The aim of this study was to identify the most important policy instruments for supporting climate change mitigation efforts in the land-use sector in Finland and increase understanding on the performance of these instruments. This was done by analysing experts' views on the most effective policy instruments related to climate change mitigation in agricultural and urban land use in Finland and identifying the criteria that experts use when evaluating these instruments. The experts' views were obtained by interviews, a workshop and a survey, and the results were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. The experts emphasized the effectiveness of economic policy instruments in the promotion of practical measures for climate change mitigation. According to the experts, the most effective policy instrument for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the land use sector would be a fee for deforestation. However, based on the analyses using four other evaluation criteria (efficiency, legality, democracy, legitimacy), economic policy instruments imply greater challenges than regulatory or informational policy instruments. Furthermore, based on the results, the coherence of economic policy instruments, i.e. to what extent they have synergies in achieving different policy objectives, needs to be carefully examined in the planning phase. In particular, more attention should be paid to the analysis of relationship across different scales of governance when designing new policy instruments for climate change mitigation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","evaluation of policy instruments for supporting greenhouse gas mitigation efforts in agricultural and urban land use","paper_609"

Better public oversight and regulation of the forest commons is thus linked to democratization. Yet evidence suggests that in a number of important cases, democratization can accelerate deforestation. Using the cases of South Nandi and Karura Forests in Kenya, this article argues that to understand why requires more careful examination of how forests are incorporated into patronage networks and how these networks are impacted by democratization struggles. Specifically, this article argues that accelerated deforestation occurs when institutional configurations allow abuse and create opportunity for forests to become incorporated into patronage networks. Democratization can then exacerbate deforestation when, as in Kenya, more competitive elections produce stresses on these patronage networks and hence create incentives for state actors to increase accumulation of forest resources for political purposes. Further, the overall volatility of democratization struggles, which makes changes in government more likely, creates incentives for those with privileged access to forests to accumulate more rapidly with no concern for sustainability in the long run. However, such forest encroachments may also generate resistance and movements aimed at re-imposing regulation on the use of the forest. When successful, these struggles over forests can both deepen democratization and transform institutional configurations to better protect forests.",NA,NA,"webofscience","deforestation and democratization: patronage, politics and forests in kenya","paper_348"

We use data from a sample of 60 nations for the period of 1990 to 2005. We find substantial support for the world polity theory that higher levels of both types of nongovernmental organizations are associated with lower rates of deforestation. We expand the analysis to test a political opportunity structure hypothesis that democracy enhances the ability of nongovernmental organizations to deal with the causes of forest loss. In doing so, we find that international and domestic nongovernmental organizations tend to decrease forest loss more in democratic rather than in repressive nations.",NA,NA,"webofscience","nongovernmental organizations, democracy, and deforestation: a cross-national analysis","paper_998"

These areas have been significantly deforested over the last 50 years due to public policies and land privatization aiming at economic development, agricultural and agribusiness expansion in Central and Amazonian Brazil. These political and economic drivers contributed to the conversion of five million hectares of Seasonal Evergreen Forests and Cerrados (Brazilian savanna) into agricultural land. In order to reverse the damaging trends of the future of the Xingu River and promote common benefits to indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, the Campaign fostered the creation of the Xingu Seed Network to promote exchange and commercialization of native seeds demanded by farmers and landholders for planting and restoring permanent preservation areas, such as riparian forests, and vegetation associated with lakes and springs of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin. The aim of this study is to examine the role played by the ?Y Ikatu Campaign in the conservation of these common-pool resources ? Xingu?s headwaters, riparian forests and rivers?and in mobilizing heterogeneous social groups living in this region to engage in the protection of the watershed.. Our analysis focuses on socially and culturally diverse inhabitants (indigenous and farmers) of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin, who are searching for innovative technologies for the recovery of riparian areas, and for income generation for local communities. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework was adopted as an approach for understanding interactions of multiple social agents, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, engaged in the process of restoration and protection of common resources. Spatial and temporal land-cover changes analysis of the Sui?a-Mi?u River Basin show an increase in deforestation during the past 40 years, primarily for soybean farming and pastures. We showed that indigenous people have a fundamental role in questioning and advancing the outcomes of restoration efforts, and monitoring environmental impact on water quality of rivers, as well as on conditions of forests and other ecosystems surrounding indigenous lands.

Despite the threats dams impose on PAs, there is a knowledge gap in assessing deforestation in PAs around large dams in the Amazon. This study investigates how deforestation affects Biodiversity Protection Areas (BioPAs) and Indigenous Lands around the Jirau and Santo Anto nio (JSA) dams (Madeira River, Rondo nia) and Belo Monte dam (Xingu River, Par a) in the Brazilian Amazon. We compared clear-cutting between PAs and control areas and the annual rates of forest change between pre -dam and post -dam periods. We discussed deforestation-related factors (e.g., PADDD events and the presence of management plans or councils). Our results show an increase in deforestation after the operation of the dams when environmental control from licensing agencies decreases and other political and economic factors are in practice. Indigenous Lands experienced a significant increase in deforestation around the Belo Monte dam, which is associated with the demarcation process and land conflicts. Surrounding the JSA dams, sustainable use BioPAs showed high deforestation rates, and 27 PADDD events were reported, four directly related to dams. In addition to dams, deforestation was associated with the crisis of Brazilian democracy and the weakening of environmental policies. In conclusion, the weak environmental control from environmental licensing agencies during dam operation and PADDD events have contributed to increased deforestation rates and additional stresses in the Amazon.",NA,NA,"webofscience","two decades of clear-cutting threats in the brazilian amazonian protected areas around the jirau, santo antonio, and belo monte large dams","paper_1514"

One of the most common techniques is the use of sun dried or kiln fired adobe bricks with mud mortar. Fired bricks are the main cause for deforestation in countries like Malawi. Although this technique is low-cost, the bricks vary largely in shape, strength and durability. This leads to weak houses which suffer considerable damage during floods and seismic events. One solution is the use of dry-stack masonry with stabilized interlocking compressed earth blocks (ICEB). This technology has the potential of substituting the current bricks by a more sustainable kind of block. This study was made in the context of the HiLoTec project, which focuses on houses in rural areas of developing countries. For this study, Malawi was chosen for a case study. This paper presents the experimental results of tests made with dry-stack ICEBs. Soil samples from Malawi were taken and studied. Since the experimental campaign could not be carried out in Malawi, a homogenization process of Portuguese soil was made to produce ICEBs at the University of Minho, Portugal. Then, the compression and tensile strength of the materials was determined via small cylinder samples. Subsequently, the compression and flexural strength of units were determined. Finally, tests to determine the compressive strength of both prisms and masonry wallets and to determine the initial shear strength of the dry interfaces were carried out. This work provides valuable data for low-cost eco-efficient housing.",NA,NA,"webofscience","characterization of dry-stack interlocking compressed earth blocks","paper_237"

Through an evaluation of two texts-a film and a book-produced in conjunction with a 2003-2004 environmental campaign, it argues that the boreal forest is constructed as a white ethnoscape and that, as a result, boreal forest conservation comes to be associated with 'white' identity, although by no means exclusively so, and certainly not without significant contradictions. The essay deploys Robyn Wiegman's notion of liberal whiteness to argue that liberal white subjectivity is cultivated in these texts by its self-conscious distancing, or disaffiliation, from colonial spatial practices. It is argued that this distancing is achieved through the active inclusion of First Nations peoples in the texts such that the boreal forest is constructed as a socio-natural working landscape. Liberal white disaffiliation is explored through three specific tropes: inclusion, inverted racial historicism and economic partnership.",NA,NA,"webofscience","ethnoscaping canada's boreal forest: liberal whiteness and its disaffiliation from colonial space","paper_600"

Neither of these approaches is felt to produce information that is reliable in terms of describing the conditions that exist in natural fires. In this paper, we present the results of the study of two fires located in the boreal forest of interior Alaska, one during the summer of 1990 and the second during the summer of 1994. In this study, we utilized remote sensing imagery for two purposes. First, pre-fire imagery was used to map the distribution of vegetation/forest cover prior to the fire. A field-sampling campaign was then conducted to estimate the levels of above and below-ground biomass levels associated with each vegetation/forest category. Second, approaches were developed to use satellite imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper to estimate three levels of fire severity in the burned forests. Ground data were again collected to estimate the percentage of biomass consumed during fires in each of these classes. By combining the two sets of information, it was possible to estimate the amounts of carbon-based greenhouse gases released during each fire. In the two fires, 25 and 38 t C ha(-1) were released, values which are two to three times greater than previously estimated for boreal forest ecosystems. These studies show that most (85%) of the carbon released originates from the burning of biomass in the ground layer (e.g., mosses, litter, and organic soil), which contrasts greatly with biomass burning in other biomes, where almost all the biomass consumed is in above-ground vegetation. To estimate the different species of gases released, we developed a fire behaviour model to divide the fires into two classes: flaming and smouldering. We then used published values to estimate the amount of different greenhouses released during these two fire phases. In a relative sense, much lower levels of carbon dioxide and higher levels of methane and carbon monoxide are released during naming fires in boreal forests because smouldering fires are responsible for burning ground-layer organic matter.",NA,NA,"webofscience","direct effects of fire on the boreal forest carbon budget","paper_477"

The paper concentrates on national-level stakeholders active in REDD+ in Nepal, and their perceptions of governance quality, with a discussion, given the focus of this special volume, that emphasizes inclusiveness, equality and resources (indicators of interest representation) and democracy, agreement and dispute settlement (indicators of decision-making). Respondents were selected from state (i.e. governmental) and non-state (i.e. civil society) interests from a range of sectors active in REDD+ at the national level. The results show that survey respondents generally found REDD+ to be inclusive, but did not consider that there was the necessary capacity, or resources, for meaningful participation.

Although a complex problem demands complex solutions, barriers to interdisciplinary visions and intersectoral coordination persist. Particularly, office-based projects (paper) rarely reach the implementation stage (action), while few contemplate the synergies between mitigation and adaptation. This article analyses climate change plans and programs for the coffee sector considering the coffee rust epidemic, a disease caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix which has generated important losses to coffee production since the 2012/2013 cycle. Structural problems created ideal conditions for this disease which has been associated with climate change, whilst the institutional response has generated new challenges for coffee producing communities who live in biodiversity hotspots like the Chiapas Sierra Madre in southern Mexico. We discuss the synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation by analyzing the campaign in favor of carbon stocks and biodiversity in shade-grown coffee plantations of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Designed in response to the current coffee rust epidemic, this campaign emphasizes deforestation, forest degradation and loss of ecosystem services that is associated with the current crisis of shade-grown coffee, with proposals set out to benefit both ecosystems and the coffee communities. We identify three challenges which mark the distance between paper and action, as exemplified in the case of the coffee crisis in the Chiapas Sierra Madre.",NA,NA,"webofscience","from paper to action in climate change mitigation and adaptation: the case of the coffee rust in chiapas","paper_703"

This research adds to our understanding of environmental degradation by evaluating the contested'' role international nongovernmental organizations play in managing environmental problems. Methods. I use cross-national data for a sample of up to 70 nations to examine the effect of international nongovernmental organizations on deforestation for the period of 1990 to 2000. The models also include relevant controls for gross national product, economic growth, population growth, democracy, government expenditures, domestic investment, forest stocks, exports, multinational corporations, and structural adjustment. Results. The main findings indicate that nations with higher levels of international nongovernmental organizations presence have lower levels of deforestation. I also examine the effects of international nongovernmental organizations at different levels of democracy by including an interaction term between international nongovernmental organizations and democracy. In doing so, I find that international nongovernmental organizations continue to reduce deforestation. However, they reduce deforestation more at higher rather than at lower levels of democracy. Conclusions. This research illustrates that international nongovernmental organizations reduce deforestation despite claims to the contrary. However, their effectiveness appears to be affected by the level of democracy in a nation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","international nongovernmental organizations and deforestation: good, bad, or irrelevant?","paper_841"

The study was conducted through interview sixty-five families in Klongsai Village, Wang Nam Khiao Sub-district, Wang Nam Khiao District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province. It was found that most household of the samples were male. The average age was 48 years old. Almost all of them were immigrants and had graduated from primary school. The main career was growing crops. Factors affecting community's participation in forest conservation activities were gender, education, benefit from forest use and the villager's attitude towards their leader with statistical significance level at 0.05. Problems and obstacles were caused by both villagers (e.g., they could not give all their best in forest conservation because they had to struggle for food and shelters), and government agencies (e.g., they were not sincere in helping villagers prolong their conservation campaign). To conserve forest resources in Moo Ban Klongsai, government organizations should reconsider their previous performances and enhance local people's awareness in forest resource conservation and supporting more cooperation between government organizations and local community and connecting other government sectors. It could be expected that to reach enduring forest conservation, government sectors should provide local people long term occupations, health services and infrastructure to ensure that they will not illegally encroach forest resources in the future.",NA,NA,"webofscience","factor affecting community's participation in forest resource conservation : klongsai village, wang nam khiao sub-district, wang nam khiao district, nakhon ratchasima province","paper_630"

In order to identify the source of variation across studies, this article conducts a meta-analysis of 32 empirical cross-country studies in the field of economics, containing 227 estimates of the impact of different governance measures on deforestation. Using an ordered probit model, we find that the choice of the governance measure is the main factor in explaining variations in the outcomes of the studies. In particular, studies using environmental policy, ownership rights, presence of environmental NGOs, and rule of law as measures of governance, are more likely to find that better governance reduces deforestation. In contrast, studies using democracy and rights as a measure of governance are more likely to find that deforestation increases, when governance is improved. The finding that not all aspects of governance improvements are equally supportive of forest conservation suggests that more nuanced analyses of specific aspects of environmental governance are required to guide evidence based policy making.",NA,NA,"webofscience","governance and deforestation - a meta-analysis in economics","paper_737"

Despite this value, tropical deforestation continues at a high rate. Emerging evidence suggests that elections can play an important role in shaping deforestation, for instance by incentivising politicians to allow increased utilisation of forests in return for political support. Nevertheless, the role of elections as driver of deforestation has not yet been comprehensively tested at broad geographic scales. Here, we created an annual database from 2001 to 2018 on political elections and forest loss for 55 tropical nations and modelled the effect of elections on deforestation. In total, 1.5 million km2 of forest was lost during this time period, especially in the Amazon, the Congo Basin and in Southeast Asia. The annual rate of deforestation increased in 37 (67 %) of the analysed countries. Deforestation was significantly lower in years with uncompetitive lower chamber elections compared to competitive election years (i.e. when the opposition can participate in elections and has a legitimate chance to gain governmental power). Our results show a pervasive loss of tropical forests and suggest that competitive elections can be potential drivers of deforestation. Future analyses at higher resolution (intra-annual defores-tation and sub-national governance) and simultaneous collection of data on additional mechanisms (legislative changes, financial investments, and binding term limits) will likely provide additional insights into the impacts of elections. We therefore recommend that organisations monitoring election transparency and fairness should also monitor environmental impacts such as forest loss, habitat destruction and resource exploitation.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the role of elections as drivers of tropical deforestation","paper_1438"

Beginning in 1916, the national government in Beijing mandated that each province and county throughout the Chinese nation celebrate Arbor Day in order to foster a modern Chinese environmental culture. This change was made in response to global discourses that linked forest cover to a modern nation's moral and economic health. Arbor Day coincided with the Tomb-Sweeping Festival, a day traditionally reserved for ancestor worship. Due to the vast climatic disparities within China, many governments planted Arbor Day trees under conditions that made it impossible for them to thrive. Nevertheless, officials throughout China continued to celebrate Arbor Day as proof of their loyalty to the government in Beijing. Arbor Day thus served more as an exercise in promoting national unity than in creating a viable reforestation campaign.",NA,NA,"webofscience","unity in the trees: arbor day and republican china, 1915-1927","paper_1530"

Some specific questions related to the BIOMASS mission still need to be addressed and the AfriSAR data collection strategy was constructed accordingly: -Verify the BIOMASS geophysical inversion method over an African tropical forest, -extend the coverage in the 100t-300t/ha biomass range, -assess the P-Band SAR for deforestation and degradation, -map a large reference area, -assess the impact of seasonal changes on the inversion schemes.

They are a major cause of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Their multiple sources are most diverse and root in nature and society. The immediate fire effects directly and the long-term landscape ecosystem degradations indirectly cause major and persisting and serious problems of public health and ecosystem service. Smoke haze from the forest and land fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2015 caused significant environmental and economic losses in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. We describe the different types of land uses and land cover where fires and smoke haze took place, and how local politics have affected fire use from 2001 to 2017. We calculated hot spots from satellite imageries as proxies for fire occurrences and applied regression analysis to understand the link between fire and local politics in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The results show that the greatest frequency of hot spots occurred in wood and oil palm plantations and logging concessions (47%), followed by conservation areas (31%) and community land (22%). Local elections involve land transactions, and fires were used as a cheap way to increase the land value. The use of fire as means of land clearing was strongly influenced by local politics. Their frequency and abundance obviously increased about a year prior to local elections. The reasons behind the correlation need to be understood so that appropriate incentives and sanctions can be put in place and deter political leaders from using fire as an incentive to their advantage.",NA,NA,"webofscience","forest and land fires, toxic haze and local politics in indonesia","paper_648"

Across 2253 municipalities, those with higher deforestation see a significant rise in deforestation during federal-and-state election years. Municipal election years raise deforestation for locations with lower deforestation, whereas all of these increases are accentuated when there is party alignment between different levels of government.

A total of 70 LAI measurements were taken from different forest types in the same areas one month later, and some spectroradiometric measurements were also collected from the nearby highway and different forest stands in the areas. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of the three types of AVIRIS data used for estimating and mapping LAI. The three types of data correspond to AVIRIS original radiance (OR), corrected radiance (CR) and retrieved surface reflectance (SR). We first simulated the total at-sensor radiances using MODTRAN4, then used ground spectroradiometric measurements taken from different targets to improve the reflectances for each pixel on the image. The CR images were obtained by subtracting path radiance from the OR images. A 10-term LAI prediction model for each type of data was constructed to predict pixel-based LAI values. Finally, the pixel-based LAI value was sliced and mapped for all the three types of images. The results of mapping LAI using the three types of AVIRIS data (OR, CR and SR) indicate that mapping LAI by SR is the most realistic, followed by CR. The poorest result occurs when mapping LAI with OR data due to atmospheric effect. The SR data can lead to higher correlation with LAI in some bands and produce higher accuracy indices for the 10-term predictive model, although some indices from the test set for SR data have a somewhat lower correlation with LAI than those produced with OR data. Therefore, in general, it can be concluded that the retrieved surface reflectance data is more effective for mapping forest LAI compared to the other two types of data.",NA,NA,"webofscience","simple calibration of aviris data and lai mapping of forest plantation in southern argentina","paper_1233"

I examine conflicts and congruencies in the context of Biodiversity Offsetting, REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), and the Rewilding movement. I ask questions that are legal (Who has what legal rights to speak for or against programs that enhance biodiversity?), epistemological (Whose expertise and knowledge matters when scientists and non-scientists don't agree?), axiological (Are some values objectively better, and why?), and normative (Whose opinions about biodiversity should count?). Many people have the right to participate in an ecological democracy: But when protecting biodiversity, who does and should have the right to be heard? I problematize the role that 'local' actors play in decision-making and describe the variegated role that experts - particularly biologists - play in ecological democracy when biodiversity preservation matters. To determine whose values and voices should be prioritized, I describe 'deep equity,' an axiological and normative groundwork for determining when biodiversity-promoting policies may be preferable even if affected citizens don't agree.",NA,NA,"webofscience","whose voices count in biodiversity conservation? ecological democracy in biodiversity offsetting, redd plus , and rewilding","paper_1573"

This work takes advantage of a nationwide titling campaign in Panama to explore the effect of private titling on forest cover across a heterogeneous landscape covering all stages of forest transition and diverse tenure arrangements. Situated in a broader matched analysis of the influence of zoning and tenure on forest cover, private management is estimated to have contributed to the deforestation of 1750-3650 km2 of mature forest nationwide from 1990 to 2020 with an average marginal effect of 15.3%. Conversely, Protected Areas and Indigenous Comarcas are estimated to have protected 1700-3900 km2 and 500-1250 km2 of mature forest, respectively. Private titling is associated with increased deforestation both during titling and years after, supporting observations that the titling process itself encourages speculative deforestation by title seekers and that private landholders value natural forests less than other land uses such as cattle. By disaggregating the data by region to highlight different stages of forest transition as well as by processes of deforestation and forest growth, this analysis shows that while private titling accelerates deforestation, it also encourages investment in reforestation. This presents a paradox for private titles and forests where agencies may perversely encourage speculative deforestation by creating stronger markets for forest-ready landscapes than for intact natural forests. In cases such as this one, where deforestation helps to secure a title, this paradox is confounded when having a title is set as a precondition for participation in a forest conservation program.",NA,NA,"webofscience","effect of land tenure on forest cover and the paradox of private titling in panama","paper_537"

Census statistics from the arid state of Rajasthan show a :ide of forests reclaiming the land. These trends obscure crucial realities that continue to undermine the claims of the state: forest ecosystems continue to disappear, expanding cover is characterized by an ecologically narrow range of species, and forest management remains rooted in a decision structure that fails to educe local knowledge and experience. More fundamentally, the flaws in the Rajasthani forest campaign reflect an entrenched pattern that has long guided authorities in the region; to govern the landscape, the state must quite literally construct forests-as mental categories, discursive tropes, and material realities-where none have existed before. The material conditions of tree cover are, in this way, influenced by the discursive forms of forest imported into the region. This paper surveys the contradictory trends in Rajasthani land cover, interrogating the relationship between the forests that expand on paper and those that dwindle on the ground. In the process, the paper contributes to ongoing work in poststructural political ecology by asking how discourse matters in the reconstitution of material ecologies and by linking the construction,ion of ecological categories to the formation of landscapes.

However, there has been no cross-national research that examines if forestry export flows from poor to rich nations is associated with higher rates of deforestation in poor nations. As such, we seek to address this gap in the literature by constructing cross-national regression models of forest loss from 1990 to 2005 for a sample of 60 poor nations. In doing so, we find substantial support for ecologically unequal exchange theory that poor nations with higher levels of forestry export flows to rich nations tend to have higher rates of deforestation. We also find that a number of other factors are related to deforestation. These include international nongovernmental organizations, democracy, total forestry production, total population growth, rural population growth, and tropical climate. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, theoretical implications, methodological implications, policy suggestions, and possible directions for future research.",NA,NA,"webofscience","ecologically unequal exchange and deforestation:a cross-national analysis of forestry export flows","paper_518"

Pending successful completion it could represent a 10-20% increase in China's national forest area and a 10% decrease in current cultivated area. In contrast to China's other forest-sector policies, SLCP uses a public payment scheme that directly engages millions of rural households as core agents of project implementation, and has the stated principals of volunteerism. Thus, insofar as current or future de facto program implementation involves decentralized, voluntary grassroots participation, SLCP represents an important departure from business as usual in how China manages its forest resources. This work draws upon current available research of the program and uses a 2003 household and village-level survey conducted by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, CAS, to examine program design, implementation and outcomes to date. Results indicate that significant problems in design and implementation exist, with these including shortfalls in subsidies delivered, lack of respect of the principals of volunteerism, and insufficient technical support and budgeting for local implementation costs. More fundamentally, some program goals appear to be based on common misperceptions regarding the linkages between forests and watershed services. Overall, SLCP contains both innovative elements (volunteerism and the direct engagement of farmers) as well as components that hark back to policies and mindsets of decades past (the program's top-down, simplified contract structure, lack of sufficient consultation with local communities and rural households, and campaign-style mobilization). The paper concludes by providing four main suggestions to improve the program: 1) Increase local community input in design and implementation, and ensure that households have full autonomy in participation choice; 2) improve technical support and budgeting for local administrative costs and capacity building; 3) clarify the environmental services targeted and verify the measures needed to acquire these services; and 4) integrate SLCP into an overall package of complementary policies aimed at the rural sector.

Therefore, not only the amount and location of forest removal has to be known (as is typically provided by scenarios), but also knowledge about the successional land-cover types and their relative areal proportions is needed. The main objective of this study was to identify these successional land-cover types and quantify their areal proportions in regions deforested during the past 37years around the city of Kisangani, D.R. Congo. The fallow vegetation continuum was categorized in different stages, adapted from existing classifications. Ground-truth points describing the present-day vegetation were obtained during a field campaign and used for supervised and validated land-cover classification of these categories, using the Landsat image of 2012. Areal proportions of successional land-cover types were then derived from the resulting land-cover map. The second objective of this study was to relate these areal proportions to time since deforestation, which is expected to influence fallow landscapes. Landsat images of 1975, 1990, and 2001 were analyzed. Present-day mature tree fallow is less abundant on areas deforested during 1975-1990. The relative areal proportions were used to refine a deforestation scenario and apply it to existing data-sets of LAI and canopy height (CH). Assuming a simple conversion of forest to cropland, the deforestation scenario projected a reduction of grid-cell-averaged CH from 25.5 to 7.5m (within deforested cells), whereas the refined scenarios that we propose show more subtle changes, with a reduced CH of 13m.

Polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) potentially offers a means of improving SAR-based estimates of forest biomass by quantifying canopy structural variability. The polarisation information is dependent on the scattering mechanisms, and the interferometric information can be used to determine the vertical location of these scattering events in the canopy. The CORSAR project (Carbon Observation and Retrieval from SAR), which is supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), has the objective to examine polarimetric decomposition and polarimetric SAR interferometry methods for estimating the effects of canopy structure in biomass-backscatter relationships. We present results from single-pass X-band interferometry and from the polarimetric coherence optimisation of repeat-pass L-band E-SAR data acquired during the SAR and Hyperspectral Airborne Campaign (SHAC 2000), and compare the InSAR DEM's with a LIDAR derived DEM that was acquired concurrently.

It varies strongly across countries and time, and is driven by several idiosyncratic as well as structural factors. Political regime types belong to the latter. Some studies suggest that more democratic countries are associated with lower rates of deforestation, whereas others report that such states might well be related to more clearing of forested land. We contribute to resolving the currently mixed evidence by re-examining, extending, and contextualizing the findings of one of the most recent empirical studies on how democracy affects deforestation. Based on a comprehensive empirical analysis using different data sources and estimation procedures, we show that levels of democracy are linked to deforestation in a U-shaped, curvilinear way: deforestation rates are less strongly pronounced in both the least and the most democratic states, but higher in partial democracies. In this U-shaped curve, however, the most democratic countries have a better forest-conservation record than states with lower democracy scores.",NA,NA,"webofscience","new evidence reveals curvilinear relationship between levels of democracy and deforestation","paper_989"

Theorists and policy-makers have been eager to put forward the virtues of democracy as a benign political influence on the environment, especially in contrast to the obvious environmental degradation under Communism that became obvious after its fall. Six measures of environmental protection or degradation are examined as the dependent variables, with the independent variables emerging from earlier tests of the impact of the environment on democracy. In the multiple regression analyses of three of the environmental indicators, deforestation, carbon dioxide emission, and soil erosion by water, the statistically significant effect of democracy on the environment actually was negative, contrary to prediction. In the fourth case, protected land area, the impact of democracy was positive while in the remaining two instances, freshwater availability and soil erosion by chemicals, there was no significant effect of democracy on the environment. Other variables such as economic development, agricultural density, European location, age of the polity, and precipitation behaved empirically as one would intuitively expect. These findings suggest that democracy cannot be viewed unidimensionally in its relationship to the environment, and that assumptions by theorists and policy-makers concerning the positive effect of democracy on the environment need to be re-examined.",NA,NA,"webofscience","democracy and the environment: an empirical assessment","paper_436"

Protection of forested areas provides long-term public goods, while their destruction provides short-term private goods for particular voters. Politicians facing a competitive election offer voters access to forested areas mainly for small-scale farming or commercial use of timber in exchange for electoral support. I test this theory of political deforestation using satellite generated global forest cover data and the results of over 1,000 national-level elections between 1982 and 2016. I find that countries that undergo a democratic transition lose an additional 0.8 percentage points of their forest cover each year, that years with close elections have over 1 percentage point per year higher forest cover loss compared to nonelection years, and that as the margin of victory in an election decreases by 10 points, the amount of deforestation increases by 0.7 percentage points per year. These increases are on the order of 5-10 times the average rate of forest loss globally. This suggests democratization is associated with underprovision of environmental public goods and contested elections are partially responsible for this underprovision.",NA,NA,"webofscience","democratization, elections, and public goods: the evidence from deforestation","paper_453"

The airborne campaign used an Embraer 110B aircraft outfitted with whole air sampling in canisters, mass-calibrated nephelometry, ozone by UV absorbance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and proton-transfer mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) to measure PM10, O-3, CO2, CO, NO, NO2, HONO, HCN, NH3, OCS, DMS, CH4, and up to 48 non-methane organic compounds (NMOC). The Brazilian smoke/haze layers extended to 2 - 3 km altitude, which is much lower than the 5 - 6 km observed at the same latitude, time of year, and local time in Africa in 2000. Emission factors (EF) were computed for the 19 tropical deforestation fires sampled and they largely compare well to previous work. However, the TROFFEE EF are mostly based on a much larger number of samples than previously available and they also include results for significant emissions not previously reported such as: nitrous acid, acrylonitrile, pyrrole, methylvinylketone, methacrolein, crotonaldehyde, methylethylketone, methylpropanal, '' acetol plus methylacetate,'' furaldehydes, dimethylsulfide, and C-1-C-4 alkyl nitrates. Thus, we recommend these EF for all tropical deforestation fires. The NMOC emissions were similar to 80% reactive, oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC). Our EF for PM10 (17.8 +/- 4 g/kg) is similar to 25% higher than previously reported for tropical forest fires and may reflect a trend towards, and sampling of, larger fires than in earlier studies. A large fraction of the total burning for 2004 likely occurred during a two-week period of very low humidity. The combined output of these fires created a massive '' mega-plume '' > 500 km across that we sampled on 8 September. The mega-plume contained high PM10 and 10 - 50 ppbv of many reactive species such as O-3, NH3, NO2, CH3OH, and organic acids. This is an intense and globally important chemical processing environment that is still poorly understood. The mega-plume or '' white ocean '' of smoke covered a large area in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay for about one month. The smoke was transported > 2000 km to the southeast while remaining concentrated enough to cause a 3 - 4-fold increase in aerosol loading in the S (a) over tildeo Paulo area for several days.",NA,NA,"webofscience","the tropical forest and fire emissions experiment: overview and airborne fire emission factor measurements","paper_1457"

Effective strength depends on the strength of a group, how well it transmits its pressures and the level of public support, all of which are linked to progress in democratization and pluralization. External pressures may change stated policy but not actual policy. Forest policy evolution is divided into three phases: exploitative (when both actual and stated policies promote exploitation), ambiguous (stated policy promotes sustainable management but actual policy remains exploitative) and sustainable management (both actual and stated policies promote sustainable management). The model is tested by applying it to the Philippines, where a sharp rise in the relative power of protectionist groups and their ability to exert pressures on government, and a significant increase in democracy and pluralism, coincided with a major change in forest policy in 1986. Progress in controlling deforestation and managing forest more sustainably throughout the tropics may therefore depend on similar political changes occurring on a larger scale. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Burma has made a transition from 50years of authoritarian rule to what its leaders call 'disciplined democracy'. This paper examines the likely consequences of the Bank's return for the forestry sector in Burma and the potential outcomes in forestry governance given the evolution of its development agenda over the past 25years. While measures to address deforestation have been applied in Southeast Asia, the success of forestry governance reforms depends to a large extent on their endorsement and adoption by local power structures and political figures, as well as on the nature of the political regime itself. The record on forestry governance in Southeast Asia is particularly poor and international financial organizations continue to neglect the local political economy of deforestation. Comparatively, few studies have attempted to investigate the relationship between types of political regimes and rates of deforestation. The paper examines two other new democracies in Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Cambodia), and the impact that governance reforms have had on their deforestation trends and land use, in order to contextualize the potential impact of the WBG's return to Burma. In Southeast Asia, powerful vested interests continue to outweigh the support inside governments or civil society for the forestry governance norms promoted by international organizations. The cases of Indonesia, Cambodia and Burma illustrate that deep patrimonial interests operate within the region and that local politics cannot be ignored by international organizations designing policy reforms.

We used Systems dynamic modeling approach to estimate forest area by simulating forest land conversion in Pakistan, projecting to 2030. The results show that rangeland, built-up area and cultivated land have increased over time; growth rate of built-up area (9%) is highest followed by rangeland area (1.7%) and cultivated area (0.3%), respectively; rangeland is the dominant category in terms of area expanded (0.74 m. ha). Sensitivity analysis showed that reducing deforestation rate to half of the past level of 1% could not significantly improve forest area; therefore, it is suggested that controlling deforestation alone is not an effective strategy unless drastic measures, e.g., demarcation of forest boundaries, land use control policy and afforestation campaign would be started in the country.",NA,NA,"webofscience","forest land conversion dynamics: a case of pakistan","paper_673"

Over the last years, the spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor specifically designed to acquire forest structure information, Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), has been used to extract forest canopy height information over large areas. Yet, GEDI has no spatial coverage for most forested areas in Canada and other high latitude regions. On the other hand, the spaceborne LiDAR called Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides a global coverage but was not specially developed to study forested ecosystems. Nonetheless, both spaceborne LiDAR sensors obtain point-based information, making spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation very challenging. This study compared the performance of both spaceborne LiDAR, GEDI and ICESat-2, combined with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 and -2 data to produce continuous canopy height maps in Canada for the year 2020. A set-aside dataset and airborne LiDAR (ALS) from a national LiDAR campaign were used for accuracy assessment. Both maps overestimated canopy height in relation to ALS data, but GEDI had a better performance than ICESat-2 with a mean difference (MD) of 0.9 m and 2.9 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.2 m and 5.2 m, respectively. However, as both GEDI and ALS have no coverage in most of the hemi-boreal forests, ICESat-2 captures the tall canopy heights expected for these forests better than GEDI. PALSAR-2 HV polarization was the most important covariate to predict canopy height, showing the great potential of L-band in comparison to C-band from Sentinel-1 or optical data from Sentinel-2.

Using GlobalTreeSearch and GTA data, the analysis reveals that China boasts some 4886 native tree species of which virtually half, 2429, are endemic to the country. With nearly one in five Chinese tree species threatened, conservation action has been implemented under the umbrella of the GTC for some hundred taxa. This included development of best-practice in propagation, population recovery in situ and creation of ex situ conservation collections as an insurance policy for the future. Although urgency prevails to scale up conservation action for many more species at the brink of extinction, the GTC offers an ecologically more nuanced conceptual framework for application in China's large-scale tree planting and reforestation efforts. This integrated approach is especially opportune now, at a time when China is reviewing the effectiveness and plans for expansion of its protected area system, but is also compelled to increase forest cover for carbon capture and economic growth. The GTC provides a comprehensive method to ascertain planting the 'right tree in the right place', but also 'for the right purpose at the right time and with the right care'.",NA,NA,"webofscience","safeguarding china's native trees - a review of integrated conservation practices between 2008 and 2020","paper_1207"

In Indonesia, governments, multilateral/bilateral agencies and NGOs have applied engagement and FPIC in the development of REDD + initiatives at national and sub-national scales. This article develops a theoretical framework by adapting governmentality to deliberative democracy and then analyses how participation and engagement are used as powerful tools to govern the introduction of REDD +. The framework is applied to two sub-national REDD+ initiatives, the Central Sulawesi Pilot Province and the Kalimantan Forest and Climate Partnership. The engagement and participatory forums employed in these cases operate to alter and discipline the activities of local agents who regulate, manage and use forestry resources. They provide a political space to introduce new knowledge and external narratives on appropriate and legitimate ways to govern land-use development. As a highly managed post-political domain they enable contested issues around forests to be debated and potentially resolved, but within a prescribed managerial framework focussed on carbon mitigation. Through engagement and discursive interaction the multiple landholders, communities, businesses and government agencies are activated as subjects and citizens of these new carbon based endeavours. Those applying engagement and EPIC need to recognise the unbalanced power relations inherent within these processes; and ensure they form an integral part of a much broader and longer term deliberative exchange, rather than required steps along the trajectory of project or program delivery.",NA,NA,"webofscience","deliberative engagement and redd plus in indonesia","paper_425"

TVA's early leaders, especially David E. Lilienthal and Gordon R. Clapp, articulated a doctrine of ''grass roots democracy'' and ''decentralization'' that protected TVA from rival federal bureaucracies and provided greater flexibility and freedom in carrying out TVA's multi-purpose mission. This doctrine also led to innovations in the professionalization of TVA's highly skilled and diverse workforce. Clapp, a recognized leader in public administration, promoted employee initiative, easy access to top management, multi-disciplinary teamwork, labor/management collaboration, and partnerships with states and localities that took account of local needs and values. The development of joint cooperative councils and conferences, along with other initiatives, were visible manifestations of this ''democratic method of administration.'' In the aftermath of Clapp's chairmanship that ended in 1954, TVA placed principal emphasis on expanding its electric power system and moved to a more traditional bureaucratic structure of tight control, accountability, and discipline. The crisis of survival that developed in the 1980s had its roots in a growing isolation, rigidity, and decline of professional excellence that was an outgrowth of this new bureaucracy. The current TVA chairman, Marvin T. Runyon, is leading a recovery effort to restore TVA's competitiveness. This effort recalls the vision and values of ''grass roots democracy'' and ''decentralization'' espoused by Clapp and Lilienthal.

The analysis is based on interviews and questionnaires of those involved in the campaigns, as well as a review of related published and unpublished documents. The results show that the target company has become more sustainable since the campaigns started, though is still failing on certain issues. These findings are supported by some Environmental Non-Government Organisations (ENGOs), although others strongly believe that the company has made no progress at all and is still involved in illegal and unsustainable practices. Despite the increased awareness of the implications and destructiveness of deforestation in Indonesia, and the increasingly dynamic role taken by international ENGOs to halt the forest loss, deforestation continues apace.",NA,NA,"webofscience","assessing the impact of environmental campaigns against the activities of a pulp and paper company in indonesia","paper_137"

The energy balance closure ratio (EBR) was 105% for a homogeneous camelina site, 86% at a sparse reforestation site, and 73% for a vineyard. We hypothesize that the lower closure in the last site was related to the limited fetch. Incorporating a vertical gradient of soil thermal properties decreased the RMSE of the energy balance at the camelina site by 16 W m(-2). At the camelina site, eddy covariance estimates of sensible and latent heat fluxes could be reproduced well using mean vertical profiles of wind and temperature, provided that the Monin-Obukhov length is known. Measured surface temperature and sensible heat fluxes suggested high excess resistance for heat (kB(-1) = 17).",NA,NA,"webofscience","an analysis of turbulent heat fluxes and the energy balance during the reflex campaign","paper_95"

All the main indicators in terms of global warming, North-South imbalance, oil reserves, water resources, biodiversity, deforestation, population growth and rural-urban shift, globalisation, over-consumption and the distribution of wealth suggest a situation almost in free-fall.
